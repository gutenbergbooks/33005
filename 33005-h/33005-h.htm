<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>The chief difficulty which Englishmen have
experienced in writing about Russia has, up
till quite lately, been the prevailing ignorance
of the English public with regard to all that
concerns Russian affairs. A singularly intelligent
Russian, who is connected with the
Art Theatre at Moscow, said to me that he
feared the new interest taken by English
intellectuals with regard to Russian literature
and Russian art. He was delighted, of course,
that they should be interested in Russian
affairs, but he feared their interest was in
danger of being crystallized in a false shape
and directed into erroneous channels.</p>

<p>This ignorance will always remain until
English people go to Russia and learn to
know the Russian people at first hand. It
is not enough to be acquainted with a certain
number of Russian writers; I say a certain
number advisedly, because, although it is true
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>vi]</a></span>
that such writers as Tolstoy and Turgenev
have long been naturalized in England, it is
equally true that some of the greatest and
most typical of Russian authors have not yet
been translated.</p>

<p>There is in England no complete translation
of Pushkin. This is much the same
as though there were in Russia no complete
translation of Shakespeare or Milton. I do
not mean by this that Pushkin is as great a
poet as Shakespeare or Milton, but I do mean
that he is the most national and the most
important of all Russian writers. There is
no translation of Saltykov, the greatest of
Russian satirists; there is no complete translation
of Leskov, one of her greatest novelists,
while Russian criticism and philosophy, as
well as almost the whole of Russian poetry, is
completely beyond the ken of England. The
knowledge of what Russian civilisation, with
its glorious fruit of literature, consists in, is still
a sealed book so far as England is concerned.</p>

<h1 class="padtop">AN OUTLINE OF<br />
RUSSIAN LITERATURE</h1>



<h2 class="padtop">CHAPTER I<br />
<br />
<small>THE ORIGINS</small></h2>


<p>For the purposes of the average Russian,
and still more for the purposes of the foreigner,
Russian literature begins with the nineteenth
century, that is to say with the reign of
Alexander I. It was then that the literary
fruits on which Russia has since fed were
born. The seeds were sown, of course,
centuries earlier; but the history of Russian
literature up to the nineteenth century is not
a history of literature, it is the history of
Russia. It may well be objected that it is
difficult to separate Russian literature from
Russian history; that for the understanding
of Russian literature an understanding of
Russian history is indispensable. This is
probably true; but, in a sketch of this dimension,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>10]</a></span>
it would be quite impossible to give even
an adequate outline of all the vicissitudes in
the life of the Russian people which have
helped and hindered, blighted and fostered
the growth of the Russian tree of letters.
All that one can do is to mention some of
the chief landmarks amongst the events which
directly affected the growth of Russian
literature until the dawn of that epoch when
its fruits became palpable to Russia and to
the world.</p>

<p>The first of these facts is the existence of
a Slav race on the banks of the Dnieper in
the seventh and eighth centuries, and the
growth of cities and trade centres such as
Kiev, Smolensk, and Novgorod, which seem
already to have been considerable settlements
when the earliest Russian records were
written. Of these, from the point of view
of literature, Kiev was the most important.
Kiev on the Dnieper was the mother of
Russian culture; Moscow and St. Petersburg
became afterwards the heirs of Kiev.</p>

<p>Another factor of vital historical importance
which had an indirect effect on the history
of Russian literature was the coming of
the Norsemen into Russia at the beginning of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>11]</a></span>
the ninth century. They came as armed merchants
from Scandinavia; they founded and
organized principalities; they took Novgorod
and Kiev. The Scandinavian Viking became
the Russian <i>Kniaz</i>, and the Varanger principality
of Kiev became the kernel of the Russian
State. In the course of time, the Norsemen
became merged in the Slavs, but left traces
of their origin in the Sagas, the <i>Byliny</i>, which
spread from Kiev all over Russia, and still
survive in some distant governments. Hence
the Norse names Oleg (Helgi), Olga (Helga),
Igor (Ingvar). The word Russian, <i>Rus</i>, the
origin and etymology of which are shrouded
in obscurity, was first applied to the men-at-arms
who formed the higher class of society
in the early Varanger states.</p>

<p>The next determining factor in the early
history of Russian literature is the Church.
Vladimir, Prince of Kiev, married the sister
of the Emperor of Byzantium and was baptized;
henceforward Christianity began to
spread (987-8), but the momentous fact is
that it was the Christianity of the East. The
pearl of the Gospels, says Soloviev, was
covered over with the dust of Byzantium,
and Russia was committed to the Greek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>12]</a></span>
tradition, the Greek rivalry with the West
and was consequently excluded from the
civilization of the West and the great intellectual
community of which Rome was the
centre. This fact is of far-reaching and
momentous importance. No less important
was the introduction of the Slavonic liturgy,
which was invented by two Greek brothers
from Saloniki, in the ninth century, who
tried to force their Macedonian dialect on
all the Slavs, and succeeded in the case
of Bulgaria and Servia. A century or so
later it reached the Russian Slavs. Through
Bulgaria, the Russians acquired a ready-made
literature and a written language in a
dialect which was partly Bulgarian and
partly Macedonian, or rather Macedonian
with Bulgarian modifications. The possession
of a written language acted as a lever
as far as culture was concerned. In the
eleventh century, Kiev was one of the most
enlightened cities in Europe.</p>

<p>The rulers of Kiev were at this time related
to the Kings of France, Hungary, Norway,
and even England. The Russian MSS. of the
eleventh century equal the best MSS. of
Western Europe of the same period. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>13]</a></span>
city of Kiev was a home of wealth, learning,
and art. Byzantine artists went to Kiev,
and Kiev sent Russian painters to the West.
There seemed at this time to be no barrier
between East and West. Nothing could be
more promising than such a beginning; but the
course of Russian history was not destined to
run smooth. In the middle of the eleventh
century, the foundations of a durable barrier
between Russia and Western Europe were
laid. This was brought about by the schism
of the Eastern and Western Churches. The
schism arose out of the immemorial rivalry
between the Greeks and the Latins, a rivalry
which ever since then has continued to exist
between Rome and Byzantium. The Slavs,
whom the matter did not concern, and who
were naturally tolerant, were the victims of
a racial hatred and a rivalry wholly alien
to them. It may seem unnecessary to dwell
upon what some may regard as an ancient
and trivial ecclesiastical dispute. But, in
its effects and in its results, this &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Querelle
de Moine</span>,&rdquo; as Leo X said when he heard of
Luther&rsquo;s action, was as momentous for the
East as the Reformation was for the West.
Sir Charles Eliot says the schism of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>14]</a></span>
Churches ranks in importance with the
foundation of Constantinople and the Coronation
of Charlemagne as one of the turning
points in the relations of West and East. He
says that for the East it was of doleful import,
since it prevented the two great divisions
from combining against the common enemy,
the Turk. It was of still more doleful import
for Russia, for the schism erected a barrier,
which soon became formidable, between it
and the civilizing influences of Western
Europe.</p>

<p>But in the eleventh and twelfth centuries,
the existence of this growing barrier was not
yet perceptible. The eleventh and twelfth
centuries in Russia were an age of Sagas and
&ldquo;Byliny,&rdquo; already clearly stamped with the
democratic character and ideal that is at
the root of all Russian literature, and which
offer so sharp a contrast to Greek and
Western ideals. In the Russian Sagas, the
most popular hero is the peasant&rsquo;s son, who
is despised and rejected, but at the critical
moment displays superhuman strength and
saves his country from the enemy; and in
return for his services is allowed to drink his
fill for three years in a tavern.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>15]</a></span>
But by far the most interesting remains of
the literature of Kiev which have reached
posterity are the <i>Chronicle of Kiev</i>, often
called the <i>Chronicle of Nestor</i>, finished at the
beginning of the twelfth century, and the <i>Story
of the Raid of Prince Igor</i>. The <i>Chronicle of
Kiev</i>, written in a cloister, rich in that epic
detail and democratic quality that characterize
the Sagas, is the basis of all later
chronicles dealing with the early history of
Russia. <i>The Story of the Raid of Prince Igor</i>,
which also belongs to the twelfth century, a
prose epic, is not only one of the most remarkable
memorials of the ancient written
language of Russia; but by virtue of its
originality, its historical truth, its vividness,
it holds a unique place in the literary history
of Europe, and offers an interesting contrast
to the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chanson de Roland</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Story of the Raid of Igor</i> tells of an
expedition made in the year 1185 against the
Polovtsy, a tribe of nomads, by Igor the son
of Sviatoslav, Prince of Novgorod, together
with other Princes. The story tells how the
Princes set out and raid the enemy&rsquo;s country;
how, successful at first, they are attacked by
overwhelming numbers and defeated; how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>16]</a></span>
Igor is taken prisoner; and how in the end
he escapes and returns home. The story is
written in rhythmical prose, with passages
where the rhythm has a more strongly
accentuated quality as of unrhymed verse.
All the incidents recorded in the epic agree
in every respect with the narrative of the
same events which is to be found in the
<i>Chronicle of Kiev</i>. It is only the manner of
presenting them which is different. What
gives the epic a unique interest is that the
author must indubitably have belonged to
the militia of Sviatoslav, Grand Duke of
Kiev; and, if he was not an eye-witness of
the events he describes with such wealth of
detail, his knowledge was at any rate first-hand
and intimate.</p>

<p>But the epic is as remarkable for the quality
of its style as it is for the historical interest of
its subject-matter. It plunges, after a short
introduction, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in medias res</i>, and the narrative
is concentrated on the dramatic moments
which give rise to the expression of lyrical
feeling, pathos and description&mdash;such as the
battle, the defeat, the ominous dream of the
Grand Duke, and the lament of the wife of
Igor on the walls of Putivl&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>17]</a></span>
<span class="i2">&ldquo;I will fly&rdquo;&mdash;she says&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Like the cuckoo down the Don;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will wet my beaver sleeve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the river Kayala;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will wash the bleeding wounds of the Prince,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wounds of his strong body.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&middot;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>&middot;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>&middot;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>&middot;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>&middot;<span class="space">&nbsp;</span>&middot;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&ldquo;O Wind, little wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, Sir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you blow so fiercely?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, on your light wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do you blow the arrows of the robbers against my husband&rsquo;s warriors?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it not enough for you to blow high beneath the clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rock the ships on the blue sea?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why, Sir, have you scattered my joy on the grassy plain?&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Throughout the poem, Nature plays an
active part in the events. When Igor is
defeated, the grasses bend with pity and the
trees are bowed to the earth with grief.
When Igor escapes, he talks with the river
Don as he fords it, and when the bandits
follow him, the woodpeckers tell them the
way with their tapping. The poem, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>18]</a></span>
contains much lamentation over the quarrels
of the Princes and the injury ensuing from
them to the Russian people, ends in the
major key. Igor is restored to his native
soil, he goes to Kiev to give thanks in the
Church, and the people acclaim the old
Princes and then the young Princes with
song.</p>

<p>A transcript of the poem, made probably
at the end of the fourteenth century, was
first discovered in 1795 by Count Musin-Pushkin,
and first published in 1800, when it
made the same kind of impression as the
publication of the <i>Songs of Ossian</i>. It was
not, however, open to Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s objection&mdash;&ldquo;Show
me the originals&rdquo;&mdash;for the
fourteenth century transcript of the original
then existed and was inspected and considered
unmistakably genuine by Karamzin and
others, but was unfortunately burnt in the
fire of Moscow.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The poem has been translated
into English, French and German, and
has given rise to a whole literature of commentaries.</p>

Up to the twelfth century, Russian life
was concentrated in the splendid and prosperous
centre of Kiev; but in the thirteenth
century came a crushing blow which was
destined to set back the clock of Russian
culture for three hundred years, namely, the
Tartar invasion. Kiev was destroyed in
1240. After this, the South was abandoned;
Lithuania and Poland became entirely separated
from the East; the Eastern principalities
centred round Moscow; the Metropolitan of
Kiev transferred his see to Moscow in 1328;
and by the fourteenth century Moscow had
taken the place of Kiev, and had become the
kernel of Russian life and culture. Russia
under the dominion of the Tartar yoke was
intellectually stagnant. The Church alone
retained its independence, and when Constantinople
fell, Moscow declared itself to be
the third and last Rome: but the independence
of the Church, although it kept
national feeling alive under the Tartar yoke,
made for stagnation rather than progress,
and the barrier between Russia and the
culture of the West was now solid and visible.</p>

<p>From the fourteenth century until the
beginning of the nineteenth century, Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>20]</a></span>
literature, instead of being a panorama of
various and equally splendid periods of
production, such as the Elizabethan epoch,
the Jacobean epoch, and the Georgian epoch,
or, as in France, the Renaissance, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand
Si&egrave;cle</i>, and the philosophic era of the eighteenth
century, has nothing to show at all
to the outward world; for during all this
time the soil from which it was to grow
was merely being prepared, and gradually,
with difficulty and delay, gaining access to
such influences as would make any growth
possible. All that is important, as far as
literature is concerned, in this period, are
those events and factors which had the effect
of making breaches in the wall which shut
Russia off from the rest of Europe; in letting
in that light which was necessary for any
literary plants to grow, and in removing those
obstacles which prevented Russia from enjoying
her rightful heritage among the rest of her
sister European nations: a heritage which
she had well employed in earlier days, and
which she had lost for a time owing to the
barbarian invasion.</p>

<p>The first event which made a breach in the
wall was the marriage of Ivan III, Tsar of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>21]</a></span>
Moscow, to Sophia Pal&aelig;ologa, the niece of the
last of the Byzantine Emperors. She brought
with her Italian architects and other foreigners,
and the work of Peter the Great, of opening
a window in Russia on to Europe, was begun.</p>

<p>The first printing press was established in
Moscow during the reign of Ivan the Terrible,
and the first book was printed in 1564. But
literature was still under the direct control
of the Church, and the Church looked upon
all innovations and all foreign learning with
the deepest mistrust. At the beginning of
the seventeenth century, Peter the Great
had a strange forerunner in the shape of that
enigmatic historical personage, the false
Demetrius, who claimed to be the murdered
son of Ivan the Terrible, and who, in spite
of his western ideas, Polish manners, and
Latin culture, succeeded in occupying the
throne of Moscow for a year. His ideal was
one of progress; but he came too soon, and
paid for his prematurity with his life.</p>

<p>But it was from Kiev and Poland that the
fruitful winds of enlightenment were next to
blow. Kiev, re-risen from its ruins and recovered
from its long slumber, became a
centre of learning, and possessed a college
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>22]</a></span>
whose curriculum was modelled on the Jesuit
schools; and although Moscow looked upon
Kiev with mistrust, an imperative demand for
schools arose in Moscow. In the meantime a
religious question had arisen fraught with
consequences for Russia: namely that of the
revision of the Liturgical books, into the text
of which, after continuous copying and recopying,
errors had crept. The demand for
revision met with great opposition, and ended
ultimately in producing a great schism in the
Russian Church, which has never been healed.
But, with the exception of the Little Russians,
there was no one at Moscow capable of preparing
texts for printing or of conducting
schools. The demand for schools and the
decision to revise the texts were simultaneous.
The revision was carried out between
1653-7, and a migration of Kiev scholars
to Moscow came about at the same time. In
1665 Latin was taught in Moscow by <span class="smcap">Simeon
Polotsky</span>, who was the first Russian verse-maker.
It is impossible to call him a poet;
he wrote what was called syllabic verse: the
number of syllables taking the place of rhythm.
As a pioneer of culture, he deserves fame; but
in the interest of literature, it was a misfortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
that his tradition was followed until the
middle of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the seventeenth century,
another influence besides that of Kiev
and Poland made itself felt. A fresh breach
in the wall came from another quarter. The
German suburb in Moscow in the seventeenth
century, called the <i>Sloboda</i>, became a centre
of European culture. Here dwelt the foreign
officers and soldiers, capitalists and artisans,
who brought with them the technical skill
and the culture of Western Europe. It was
here that the Russian stage was born. The
Protestant pastor of the <i>Sloboda</i>, Gregory,
was commanded to write a comedy by the
Tsar Alexis, in 1672, on the occasion of the
birth of the Tsarevitch. A theatre was built
in the village of Preobrazhenskoe (Transfiguration),
and a play on the subject of Esther and
Ahasuerus was produced there. It was here
also in 1674 that the ballet was introduced.
A regular company was formed; several
plays translated from the German were produced,
and the first original play written in
Russia was <i>The Prodigal Son</i>, by Simeon
Polotsky.</p>

<p>Thus, at the end of the seventeenth century,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>24]</a></span>
Russia was ready for any one who should
be able to give a decisive blow to the
now crumbling wall between herself and the
West. For, by the end of the seventeenth
century, Russia, after having been centralized
in Moscow by Ivan III, and enlarged by
Ivan IV, had thrown off the Tartar yoke.
She had passed through a period of intestine
strife, trouble, anarchy, and pretenders, not
unlike the Wars of the Roses; she had fought
Poland throughout the whole of the seventeenth
century, from her darkest hour of
anarchy, when the Poles occupied Moscow.
It was then that Russia had arisen, expelled
the invaders, reasserted her nationality and
her independence, and finally emerged out
of all these vicissitudes, the great Slavonic
state; while Poland, Russia&rsquo;s superior in
culture and civilization, had sunk into the
position of a dependency.</p>

<p>The man whom the epoch needed was forthcoming.
His name was Peter. He carried
on the work which had been begun, but in
quite an original manner, and gave it a
different character. He not only made a
breach in the wall, but he forced on his
stubborn and conservative subjects the habits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>25]</a></span>
and customs of the West. He revolutionized
the government and the Church, and turned
the whole country upside down with his
explosive genius. He abolished the Russian
Patriarchate, and crushed the power of the
Church once and for all, by making it entirely
depend on the State, as it still does.
He simplified the Russian script and the
written language; he caused to be made
innumerable translations of foreign works on
history, geography, and jurisprudence. He
founded the first Russian newspaper. But
Peter the Great did not try to draw Russia
into an alien path; he urged his country with
whip, kick, and spur to regain its due place,
which it had lost by lagging behind, on the
path it was naturally following. Peter the
Great&rsquo;s reforms, his manifold and superhuman
activity, produced no immediate fruits
in literature. How could it? To blame him
for this would be like blaming a gardener for
not producing new roses at a time when he
was relaying the garden. He was completely
successful in opening a window on to Europe,
through which Western influence could stream
into Russia. This was not slow in coming
about; and the foreign influence from the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
of the reign of Peter the Great onwards divided
directly into two different currents: the
French and the German. The chief representatives
of the German influence in the
eighteenth century were <span class="smcap">Tatishchev</span>, the
founder of Russian history, and <span class="smcap">Michael
Lomonosov</span>.</p>

<p>Michael Lomonosov (1714-1765), a man
with an incredibly wide intellectual range,
was a mathematician, a chemist, an astronomer,
a political economist, a historian, an
electrician, a geologist, a grammarian and
a poet. The son of a peasant, after an
education acquired painfully in the greatest
privation, he studied at Marburg and Freiburg.
He was the Peter the Great of the
Russian language; he scratched off the crust
of foreign barbarisms, and still more by his
example than his precepts&mdash;which were pedantic&mdash;he
displayed it in its native purity,
and left it as an instrument ready tuned for
a great player. He fought for knowledge,
and did all he could to further the founding
of the University of Moscow, which was done
in 1755 by the Empress Elizabeth. This last
event is one of the most important landmarks
in the history of Russian culture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>27]</a></span>
The foremost representative of French
influence was <span class="smcap">Prince Kantemir</span> (1708-44),
who wrote the first Russian literary verse&mdash;satires&mdash;in
the pseudo-classic French manner,
modelled on Boileau. But by far the most
abundant source of French ideas in Russia
during the eighteenth century was Catherine
II, the German Princess. During Catherine&rsquo;s
reign, French influence was predominant in
Russia. The Empress was the friend of
Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Diderot. Diderot
came to St. Petersburg, and the Russian
military schools were flooded with French
teachers. Voltaire and Rousseau were the
fashion, and cultured society was platonically
enamoured of the <i>Rights of Man</i>. Catherine
herself, besides being a great ruler and diplomatist,
was a large-minded philosopher, an
elegant and witty writer. But the French
Revolution had a damping effect on all liberal
enthusiasm, for the one thing an autocrat,
however enlightened, finds difficulty in understanding,
is a revolution.</p>

<p>This change of point of view proved disastrous
for the writer of what is the most
thoughtful book of the age: namely <span class="smcap">Radishchev</span>,
an official who wrote a book in twenty-five
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>28]</a></span>
chapters called <i>A Journey from St.
Petersburg to Moscow</i>. Radishchev gave a
simple and true account of the effects of serfdom,
a series of pictures drawn without
exaggeration, showing the appalling evils of
the system, and appealing to the conscience
of the slave-owners; the book contained
also a condemnation of the Censorship. It
appeared in 1790, with the permission of the
police. It was too late for the times; for in
1790 the events in France were making all
the rulers of Europe pensive. Radishchev was
accused of being a rebel, and was condemned
to death. The sentence was commuted to
one of banishment to Eastern Siberia. He was
pardoned by the Emperor Paul, and reinstated
by the Emperor Alexander; but he ultimately
committed suicide on being threatened in jest
with exile once more. Until 1905 it was very
difficult to get a copy of this book. Thus
Radishchev stands out as the martyr of Russian
literature; the first writer to suffer for
expressing opinions at the wrong moment:
opinions which had they been stated in this
case twenty years sooner would have coincided
with those published by the Empress herself.</p>

<p>Catherine&rsquo;s reign, which left behind it many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>29]</a></span>
splendid results, and had the effect of bestowing
European culture on Russia, produced
hardly a single poet or prose-writer
whose work can be read with pleasure to-day,
although a great importance was attached to
the writing of verse. There were poets in
profusion, especially writers of Odes, the best
known of whom was <span class="smcap">Derzhavin</span> (1743-1816),
a brilliant master of the pseudo-classical, in
whose work, in spite of its antiquated convention,
elements of real poetical beauty are
to be found, which entitle him to be called the
first Russian poet. But so far no national
literature had been produced. French was
the language of the cultured classes. Literature
had become an artificial plaything, to be
played with according to French rules; but
the Russian language was waiting there, a
language which possessed, as Lomonosov
said, &ldquo;the vivacity of French, the strength of
German, the softness of Italian, the richness
and powerful conciseness of Greek and Latin&rdquo;&mdash;waiting
for some one who should have the
desire and the power to use it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<br />
<small>THE NEW AGE&mdash;PUSHKIN</small></h2>


<p>The value of Russian literature, its peculiar
and unique message to the world, would not
be sensibly diminished, had everything it
produced from the twelfth to the beginning
of the nineteenth century perished, with the
exception of <i>The Raid of Prince Igor</i>. With
the beginning of the nineteenth century,
and the accession of Alexander I, the New
Age began, and the real dawn of Russian
literature broke. It was soon to be followed
by a glorious sunrise. The literature which
sprang up now and later, was profoundly
affected by public events; and public events
during this epoch were intimately linked with
the events which were happening in Western
Europe. It was the epoch of the Napoleonic
wars, and Russia played a vital part in that
drama. Public opinion, after enthusiasm had
been roused by the deeds of Suvorov, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>31]</a></span>
exasperated and humiliated by Napoleon&rsquo;s
subsequent victories over Russian arms. But
when Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812, a
wave of patriotism swept over the country,
and the struggle resulted in an increased sense
of unity and nationality. Russia emerged
stronger and more solid from the struggle.
As far as foreign affairs were concerned,
the Emperor Alexander I&mdash;on whom everything
depended&mdash;played his national part
well, and he fitly embodied the patriotic
movement of the day. At the beginning of
his reign he raised great hopes of internal
reform which were never fulfilled. He was
a dreamer of dreams born out of his due time;
a pupil of La Harpe, the Swiss Jacobin, who
instilled into him aspirations towards liberty,
truth and humanity, which throughout remained
his ideals, but which were too vague
to lead to anything practical or definite. His
reign was thus a series of more or less
undefined and fitful struggles to put the
crooked straight. He desired to give Russia
a constitution, but the attempts he made to
do so proved fruitless; and towards the end
of his life he is said to have been considerably
influenced by Metternich. It is at any rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>32]</a></span>
a fact that during these years reaction once
more triumphed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless windows had been opened
which could not be shut, and the light which
had streamed in produced some remarkable
fruits.</p>

<p>When Alexander I came to the throne, the
immediate effect of his accession was the ungagging
of literature, and the first writer of
importance to take advantage of this new
state of things was <span class="smcap">Karamzin</span> (1726-1826).
In 1802 he started a new review called the
<i>Messenger of Europe</i>. This was not his <i>d&eacute;but</i>.
In the reign of Catherine, Karamzin had been
brought to Moscow from the provinces, and
initiated into German and English literature.
In 1789-90 he travelled abroad and visited
Switzerland, London and Paris. On his
return, he published his impressions in the
shape of &ldquo;Letters of a Russian Traveller&rdquo;
in the <i>Moscow Journal</i>, which he founded
himself. His ideals were republican; he was
an enthusiastic admirer of England and
the Swiss, and the reforms of Peter the
Great. But his importance in Russian
literature lies in his being the first Russian
to write unstudied, simple and natural prose,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>33]</a></span>
Russian as spoken. He published two sentimental
stories in his <i>Journal</i>, but the reign
of Catherine II which now came to an
end (1796) was followed by a period of unmitigated
censorship, which lasted throughout
the reign of the Emperor Paul, until
Alexander I came to the throne. The new
review which Karamzin then started differed
radically from all preceding Russian reviews
in that it dealt with politics and made <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles
lettres</i> and criticism a permanent feature.
As soon as Karamzin had put this review on
a firm basis, he devoted himself to historical
research, and the fruit of his work in this
field was his <i>History of the Russian Dominion</i>,
in twelve volumes; eight published in 1816,
the rest in 1821-1826. The Russian language
was, as has been said, like an instrument waiting
for a great player to play on it, and to make
use of all its possibilities. Karamzin accomplished
this, in the domain of prose. He
spoke to the Russian heart by speaking
Russian, pure and unmarred by stilted and
alien conventionalisms.</p>

<p>The publication of Karamzin&rsquo;s history was
epoch-making. In the first place, the success
of the work was overwhelming. It was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>34]</a></span>
first time in Russian history that a prose work
had enjoyed so immense a success. Not only
were the undreamed-of riches of the Russian
language revealed to the Russians in the style,
but the subject-matter came as a surprise.
Karamzin, as Pushkin put it, revealed Russia
to the Russians, just as Columbus discovered
America. He made the dry bones of history
live, he wrote a great and glowing prose epic.
His influence on his contemporaries was
enormous. His work received at once the
consecration of a classic, and it inspired
Pushkin with his most important if not his
finest achievement in dramatic verse (<i>Boris
Godunov</i>).</p>

<p>The first Russian poet of national importance
belongs likewise to this epoch, namely
<span class="smcap">Krylov</span> (1769<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>-1844), although he had
written a great deal for the stage in the preceding
reigns, and continued to write for a
long time after the death of Alexander I.
Krylov is also a Russian classic, of quite a
different kind. The son of an officer of the
line, he started by being a clerk in the provincial
magistrature. Many of his plays
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>35]</a></span>
were produced with success, though none of
them had any durable qualities. But it was
not until 1805 that he found his vocation
which was to write fables. The first of these
were published in 1806 in the <i>Moscow
Journal</i>; from that time onward he went on
writing fables until he died in 1844.</p>

<p>His early fables were translations from La
Fontaine. They imitate La Fontaine&rsquo;s free
versification and they are written in iambics
of varying length. They were at once successful,
and he continued to translate fables from
the French, or to adapt from &AElig;sop or other
sources. But as time went on, he began to
invent fables of his own; and out of the two
hundred fables which he left at his death,
forty only are inspired by La Fontaine and
seven suggested by &AElig;sop: the remainder
are original. Krylov&rsquo;s translations of La
Fontaine are not so much translations as
re-creations. He takes the same subject, and
although often following the original in every
single incident, he thinks out each <i>motif</i>
for himself and re-creates it, so that his translations
have the same personal stamp and
the same originality as his own inventions.</p>

<p>This is true even when the original is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>36]</a></span>
masterpiece of the highest order, such as La
Fontaine&rsquo;s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Deux Pigeons</i>. You would think
the opening lines&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Deux pigeons s&rsquo;amoient d&rsquo;amour tendre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">L&rsquo;un d&rsquo;eux s&rsquo;ennuyant au logis<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fut assez fou pour entreprendre<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Un voyage en lointain pays&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>were untranslatable; that nothing could be
subtracted from them, and that still less
could anything be added; one ray the more,
one shade the less, you would think, would
certainly impair their nameless grace. But
what does Krylov do? He re-creates the
situation, expanding La Fontaine&rsquo;s first line
into six lines, makes it his own, and stamps
on it the impress of his personality and his
nationality. Here is a literal translation of
the Russian, in rhyme. (I am not ambitiously
trying a third English version.)</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Two pigeons lived like sons born of one mother.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neither would eat nor drink without the other;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where you see one, the other&rsquo;s surely near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every joy they halved and every tear;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>37]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They never noticed how the time flew by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sighed, but it was not a weary sigh.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>This gives the sense of Krylov&rsquo;s poem word
for word, except for what is the most important
touch of all in the last line. The trouble
is that Krylov has written six lines which
are as untranslatable as La Fontaine&rsquo;s four;
and he has made them as profoundly Russian
as La Fontaine&rsquo;s are French. Nothing could
be more Russian than the last line, which it
is impossible to translate; because it should
run&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;They were sometimes sad, but they never felt <i>ennui</i>&rdquo;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>literally, &ldquo;it was never <em>boring</em> to them.&rdquo;
The difficulty is that the word for <em>boring</em> in
Russian, <i>skuchno</i>, which occurs with the
utmost felicity in contradistinction to <em>sad</em>,
<i>grustno</i>, cannot be rendered in English in its
poetical simplicity. There are no six lines
more tender, musical, wistful, and subtly
poetical in the whole of Russian literature.</p>

<p>Krylov&rsquo;s fables, like La Fontaine&rsquo;s, deal with
animals, birds, fishes and men; the Russian
peasant plays a large part in them; often
they are satirical; nearly always they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>38]</a></span>
bubbling with humour. A writer of fables
is essentially a satirist, whose aim it is
sometimes to convey pregnant sense, keen
mockery or scathing criticism in a veiled
manner, sometimes merely to laugh at human
foibles, or to express wisdom in the form of
wit, yet whose aim it always is to amuse.
But Krylov, though a satirist, succeeded in
remaining a poet. It has been said that his
images are conventional and outworn&mdash;that
is to say, he uses the machinery of Zephyrs,
Nymphs, Gods and Demigods,&mdash;and that
his conceptions are antiquated. But what
splendid use he makes of this machinery!
When he speaks of a Zephyr you feel it is
a Zephyr blowing, for instance, as when
the ailing cornflower whispers to the breeze.
Sometimes by the mere sound of his verse
he conveys a picture, and more than a
picture, as in the Fable of the Eagle and
the Mole, in the first lines of which he
makes you see and hear the eagle and his
mate sweeping to the dreaming wood, and
swooping down on to the oak-tree. Or again,
in another fable, the Eagle and the Spider,
he gives in a few words the sense of
height and space, as if you were looking down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>39]</a></span>
from a balloon, when the eagle, soaring over
the mountains of the Caucasus, sees the end
of the earth, the rivers meandering in the
plains, the woods, the meadows in all their
spring glory, and the angry Caspian Sea,
darkling like the wing of a raven in the
distance. But his greatest triumph, in this
respect, is the fable of the Ass and the Nightingale,
in which the verse echoes the very trills
of the nightingale, and renders the stillness and
the delighted awe of the listeners,&mdash;the lovers
and the shepherd. Again a convention, if
you like, but what a felicitous convention!</p>

<p>The fables are discursive like La Fontaine&rsquo;s,
and not brief like &AElig;sop&rsquo;s; but like La Fontaine,
Krylov has the gift of summing up a
situation, of scoring a sharp dramatic effect
by the sudden evocation of a whole picture in
a terse phrase: as, for instance, in the fable of
the Peasants and the River: the peasants go
to complain to the river of the conduct of the
streams which are continually overflowing
and destroying their goods, but when they
reach the river, they see half their goods
floating on it. &ldquo;They looked at each other,
and shaking their heads,&rdquo; says Krylov,
&ldquo;went home.&rdquo; The two words &ldquo;went home&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>40]</a></span>
in Russian (<i>poshli domoi</i>) express their hopelessness
more than pages of rhetoric. This is
just one of those terse effects such as La
Fontaine delights in.</p>

<p>Krylov in his youth lived much among the
poor, and his language is peculiarly native,
racy, nervous, and near to the soil. It is the
language of the people and of the peasants,
and it abounds in humorous turns. He is,
moreover, always dramatic, and his fables
are for this reason most effective when read
aloud or recited. He is dramatic not only
in that part of the fable which is narrative,
but in the prologue, epilogue, or moral&mdash;the
author&rsquo;s commentary; he adapts himself
to the tone of every separate fable, and becomes
himself one of the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>.
Sometimes his fables deal with political
events&mdash;the French Revolution, Napoleon&rsquo;s
invasion of Russia, the Congress of Vienna;
the education of Alexander I by La Harpe,
in the well-known fable of the Lion who sends
his son to be educated by the Eagle, of whom
he consequently learns how to make nests.
Sometimes they deal with internal evils and
abuses: the administration of justice, in fables
such as that of the peasant who brings a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>41]</a></span>
case against the sheep and is found guilty
by the fox; the censorship is aimed at in
the fable of the nightingale bidden to sing
in the cat&rsquo;s claws; the futility of bureaucratic
regulations in the fable of the sheep
who are devoured by their superfluous watchdogs,
or in that of the sheep who are told
solemnly and pompously to drag any offending
wolf before the nearest magistrate; or, again,
in that of the high dignitary who is admitted
immediately into paradise because on earth
he left his work to be done by his secretaries&mdash;for
being obviously a fool, had he done his
work himself, the result would have been
disastrous to all concerned. Sometimes they
deal merely with human follies and affairs,
and the idiosyncrasies of men.</p>

<p>Krylov&rsquo;s fables have that special quality
which only permanent classics possess of
appealing to different generations, to people
of every age, kind and class, for different
reasons; so that children can read them
simply for the story, and grown-up people for
their philosophy; their style pleases the
unlettered by its simplicity, and is the envy
and despair of the artist in its supreme
art. Pushkin calls him &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le plus national et
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>42]</a></span>
le plus populaire de nos po&egrave;tes</span>&rdquo; (this was
true in Pushkin&rsquo;s day), and said his fables
were read by men of letters, merchants,
men of the world, servants and children.
His work bears the stamp of ageless modernity
just as <i>The Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i> or Cicero&rsquo;s
letters seem modern. It also has the peculiarly
Russian quality of unexaggerated realism.
He sees life as it is, and writes down
what he sees. It is true that although his
style is finished and polished, he only at
times reaches the high-water mark of what
can be done with the Russian language: his
style, always idiomatic, pregnant and natural,
is sometimes heavy, and even clumsy; but
then he never sets out to be anything more
than a fabulist. In this he is supremely
successful, and since at the same time he
gives us snatches of exquisite poetry, the
greater the praise to him. But, when all is
said and done, Krylov has the talisman which
defies criticism, baffles analysis, and defeats
time: namely, charm. His fables achieved
an instantaneous popularity, which has never
diminished until to-day.</p>

<p>Internal political events proved the next
factor in Russian literature; a factor out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>43]</a></span>
which the so-called romantic movement was
to grow.</p>

<p>During the Napoleonic wars a great many
Russian officers had lived abroad. They came
back to Russia after the Congress of Vienna
in 1815, teeming with new ideas and new
ideals. They took life seriously, and were
called by Pushkin the Puritans of the North.
Their aim was culture and the public welfare.
They were not revolutionaries; on the contrary,
they were anxious to co-operate with
the Government. They formed for their purpose
a society, in imitation of the German
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tugendbund</i>, called <i>The Society of Welfare</i>:
its aims were philanthropic, educational, and
economic. It consisted chiefly of officers of
the Guard, and its headquarters were at St.
Petersburg. All this was known and approved
of by the Emperor. But when the Government
became reactionary, this peaceful progressive
movement changed its character. The
Society of Welfare was closed in 1821, and its
place was taken by two new societies, which,
instead of being political, were social and revolutionary.
The success of the revolutionary
movements in Spain and in Italy encouraged
these societies to follow their example.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
The death of Alexander I in 1825 forced
them to immediate action. The shape it took
was the &ldquo;Decembrist&rdquo; rising. Constantine,
the Emperor&rsquo;s brother, renounced his claim to
the throne, and was succeeded by his brother
Nicholas. December 14 (O.S.) was fixed
for the day on which the Emperor should
receive the oath of allegiance of his troops.
An organized insurrection took place, which
was confined to certain regiments. The
Emperor was supported by the majority of
the Guards regiments, and the people showed
no signs of supporting the rising, which was at
once suppressed.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-five of the conspirators
were condemned. Five of them
were hanged, and among them the poet
<span class="smcap">Ryleev</span> (1795-1826). But although the
political results of the movement were nil,
the effect of the movement on literature was
far-reaching. Philosophy took the place of
politics, and liberalism was diverted into
the channel of romanticism; but out of this
romantic movement came the springtide of
Russian poetry, in which, for the first time, the
soul of the Russian people found adequate
expression. And the very fact that politics
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>45]</a></span>
were excluded from the movement proved, in
one sense, a boon to literature: for it gave
Russian men of genius the chance to be writers,
artists and poets, and prevented them from
exhausting their whole energy in being inefficient
politicians or unsuccessful revolutionaries.
I will dwell on the drawbacks, on
the dark side of the medal, presently.</p>

<p>As far as the actual Decembrist movement
is concerned, its concrete and direct legacy
to literature consists in the work of Ryleev,
and its indirect legacy in the most famous
comedy of the Russian stage, <i>Gore ot Uma</i>,
&ldquo;The Misfortune of being Clever,&rdquo; by
<span class="smcap">Griboyedov</span> (1795-1829).</p>

<p>Ryleev&rsquo;s life was cut short before his
poetical powers had come to maturity. It is
idle to speculate what he might have achieved
had he lived longer. The work which he
left is notable for its pessimism, but still
suffers from the old rhetorical conventions
of the eighteenth century and the imitation
of French models; moreover he looked on
literature as a matter of secondary importance.
&ldquo;I am not a poet,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am
a citizen.&rdquo; In spite of this, every now and
then there are flashes of intense poetical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
inspiration in his work; and he struck one
or two powerful chords&mdash;for instance, in his
stanzas on the vision of enslaved Russia,
which have a tense strength and fire that
remind one of Emily Bront&euml;. He was a poet
as well as a citizen, but even had he lived to
a prosperous old age and achieved artistic
perfection in his work, he could never have
won a brighter aureole than that which his
death gained him. The poems of his last
days in prison breathe a spirit of religious
humility, and he died forgiving and praying
for his enemies. His name shines in Russian
history and Russian literature, as that of a
martyr to a high ideal.</p>

<p>Griboyedov, the author of <i>Gore ot Uma</i>, a
writer of a very different order, although not
a Decembrist himself, is a product of that
period. His comedy still remains the unsurpassed
masterpiece of Russian comedy,
and can be compared with Beaumarchais&rsquo;
<i>Figaro</i> and Sheridan&rsquo;s <i>School for Scandal</i>.</p>

<p>Griboyedov was a Foreign Office official,
and he was murdered when Minister Plenipotentiary
at Teheran, on January 30, 1829.
He conceived the plot of his play in 1816,
and read aloud some scenes in St. Petersburg
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>47]</a></span>
in 1823-24. They caused a sensation in
literary circles, and the play began to circulate
rapidly in MSS. Two fragments of the drama
were published in one of the almanacs, which
then took the place of literary reviews. But
beyond this, Griboyedov could neither get
his play printed nor acted. Thousands of
copies circulated in MSS., but the play was
not produced on the stage until 1831, and
then much mutilated; and it was not printed
until 1833.</p>

<p><i>Gore ot Uma</i> is written in verse, in iambics
of varying length, like Krylov&rsquo;s fables. The
unities are preserved. The action takes place
in one day and in the same house&mdash;that of
Famusov, an elderly gentleman of the Moscow
upper class holding a Government appointment.
He is a widower and has one daughter,
Sophia, whose sensibility is greater than her
sense; and the play opens on a scene where
the father discovers her talking to his secretary,
Molchalin, and says he will stand no nonsense.
Presently, the friend of Sophia&rsquo;s childhood,
Chatsky, arrives after a three years&rsquo; absence
abroad; Chatsky is a young man of independent
ideas whose misfortune it is to be
clever. He notices that Sophia receives him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>48]</a></span>
coldly, and later on he perceives that she is
in love with Molchalin,&mdash;a wonderfully drawn
type, the perfect climber, time-server and
place-seeker, and the incarnation of convention,&mdash;who
does not care a rap for Sophia.
Chatsky declaims to Famusov his contempt
for modern Moscow, for the slavish worship
by society of all that is foreign, for its
idolatry of fashion and official rank, its
hollowness and its convention. Famusov, the
incarnation of respectable conventionality, does
not understand one word of what he is saying.</p>

<p>At an evening party given at Famusov&rsquo;s
house, Chatsky is determined to find out whom
Sophia loves. He decides it is Molchalin, and
lets fall a few biting sarcasms about him to
Sophia; and Sophia, to pay him back for his
sarcasm, lets it be understood by one of the
guests that he is mad. The half-spoken hint
spreads like lightning; and the spreading of
the news is depicted in a series of inimitable
scenes. Chatsky enters while the subject
is being discussed, and delivers a long tirade
on the folly of Moscow society, which only
confirms the suspicions of the guests; and he
finds when he gets to the end of his speech
that he is speaking to an empty room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>49]</a></span>
In the fourth act we see the guests leaving
the house after the party. Chatsky is waiting
for his carriage. Sophia appears on the staircase
and calls Molchalin. Chatsky, hearing
her voice, hides behind a pillar. Liza, Sophia&rsquo;s
maid, comes to fetch Molchalin, and knocks at
his door. Molchalin comes out, and not knowing
that Sophia or Chatsky are within hearing,
makes love to Liza and tells her that he only
loves Sophia out of duty. Then Sophia appears,
having heard everything. Molchalin
falls on his knees to her: she is quite inexorable.
Chatsky comes forward and begins to
speak his mind&mdash;when all is interrupted by the
arrival of Famusov, who speaks his. Chatsky
shakes the dust of the house and of Moscow
off his feet, and Sophia is left without Chatsky
and without Molchalin.</p>

<p>The <i>Gore ot Uma</i> is a masterpiece of satire
rather than a masterpiece of dramatic comedy.
That is to say that, as a satire of the Moscow
society of the day and of the society of
yesterday, and of to-morrow, it is immortal,
and forms a complete work: but as a comedy
it does not. Almost every scene separately
is perfect in itself, but dramatically it does
not group itself round one central idea or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>50]</a></span>
one mainspring of action. Judged from the
point of view of dramatic propriety, the
behaviour of the hero is wildly improbable
throughout; there is no reason for the spectator
to think he should be in love with Sophia;
if he is, there is no reason for him to behave
as he does; if a man behaved like that, declaiming
at an evening party long speeches on
the decay of the times, the most frivolous of
societies would be justified in thinking him
mad.</p>

<p>Pushkin hit on the weak point of the play
as a play when he wrote: &ldquo;In <i>The Misfortune
of being Clever</i> the question arises,
Who is clever? and the answer is Griboyedov.
Chatsky is an honourable young man who
has lived for a long time with a clever man
(that is to say with Griboyedov), and learnt
his clever sarcasms; but to whom does he
say them? To Famusov, to the old ladies
at the party. This is unforgivable, because
the first sign of a clever man is to know at
once whom he is dealing with.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what makes the work a masterpiece
is the naturalness of the characters, the
dialogue, the comedy of the scenes which
represent Moscow society. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>51]</a></span>
extraordinary that on so small a scale, in four short
acts, Griboyedov should have succeeded in
giving so complete a picture of Moscow
society, and should have given the dialogue,
in spite of its being in verse, the stamp of
conversational familiarity. The portraits are
all full-length portraits, and when the play
is produced now, the rendering of each part
raises as much discussion in Russia as a
revival of one of Sheridan&rsquo;s comedies in
England.</p>

<p>As for the style, nearly three-quarters of
the play has passed into the Russian language.
It is forcible, concise, bitingly sarcastic, it is
as neat and dry as W.&nbsp;S. Gilbert, as elegant
as La Fontaine, as clear as an icicle, and as
clean as the thrust of a sword. But perhaps
the crowning merit of this immortal satire is
its originality. It is a product of Russian
life and Russian genius, and as yet it is without
a rival.</p>

<p>Outside the current of politics and political
aspirations, there appeared during this same
epoch a poet who exercised a considerable
influence over Russian literature, and who
devoted himself exclusively to poetry. This
was <span class="smcap">Basil Zhukovsky</span> (1783-1852). He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>52]</a></span>
opened the door of Russian literature on the
fields of German and English poetry. The
first poem he published in 1802 was a translation
of Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i>; this, and an imitation
of B&uuml;rger&rsquo;s <i>Leonore</i>, which affected all Slav
literatures, brought him fame. Later, he
translated Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Maid of Orleans</i>, his
ballads, some of the lyrics of Uhland, Goethe,
Hebbel, and a great quantity of other foreign
poems. His translations were faithful, but
in spite of this he gave them the stamp of
his own dreamy personality. He was made
tutor to the Tsarevitch Alexander&mdash;afterwards
Alexander II,&mdash;and for a time his production
ceased; but when this task was finished, he
braced himself in his old age to translate <i>The
Odyssey</i>, and this translation appeared in
1848-50. In this work he obeyed the first
great law of translation, &ldquo;Thou shalt not
turn a good poem into a bad one.&rdquo; He produced
a beautiful work; but he also did what
all other translators of Homer have done;
he took the Homer out and left the Zhukovsky,
and with it something sentimental, elegiac,
and didactic.</p>

<p>Zhukovsky&rsquo;s greatest service to Russian
literature consisted in his exploding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>53]</a></span>
superstition that the literature of France was
the only literature that counted, and introducing
literary Russia to the poets of England
and Germany rather than of France. But
apart from this, he is the first and best
translator in European literature, for what
Krylov did with some of La Fontaine&rsquo;s fables,
he did for all the literature he touched&mdash;he
re-created it in Russian, and made it his own.
In his translation of Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i>, for instance,
he not only translates the poet&rsquo;s meaning
into musical verse, but he conveys the
intangible atmosphere of dreamy landscape,
and the poignant accent which makes that
poem the natural language of grief. It is
characteristic of him that, thirty-seven years
after he translated the poem, he visited Stoke
Poges, re-read Gray&rsquo;s <i>Elegy</i> there, and made
another translation, which is still more
faithful than the first.</p>

<p>The Russian language was by this time
purified from all outward excrescences, released
from the bondage of convention and
the pseudo-classical, open to all outside influences,
and only waiting, like a ready-tuned
instrument, on which Krylov and Zhukovsky
had already sounded sweet notes and deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>54]</a></span>
tones, and which Karamzin had proved to be
a magnificent vehicle for musical and perspicuous
prose, for a poet of genius to come
and sound it from its lowest note to the top
of its compass, for there was indeed much
music and excellent voice to be plucked from
it. At the appointed hour the man came.
It was <span class="smcap">Pushkin</span>. He arrived at a time when
a battle of words was raging between the so-called
classical and romantic schools. The
pseudo-classical, with all its mythological
machinery and conventional apparatus, was
totally alien to Russia, and a direct and slavish
imitation of the French. On the other hand,
the utmost confusion reigned as to what constituted
romanticism. To each single writer it
meant a different thing: &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfon&ccedil;ez Racine</span>,&rdquo;
and the unities, in one case; or ghosts,
ballads, legends, local colour in another; or
the defiance of morality and society in another.
Zhukovsky, in introducing German romanticism
into Russia, paved the way for its death,
and for the death of all exotic fashions and
models; for he paved the way for Pushkin to
render the whole quarrel obsolete by creating
models of his own and by founding a national
literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>55]</a></span>
Pushkin was born on May 26, 1799, at
Moscow. He was of ancient lineage, and
inherited African negro blood on his mother&rsquo;s
side, his mother&rsquo;s grandmother being the
daughter of Peter the Great&rsquo;s negro, Hannibal.
Until he was nine years old, he did not show
signs of any unusual precocity; but from then
onwards he was seized with a passion for
reading which lasted all his life. He read
Plutarch&rsquo;s <i>Lives</i>, the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i>
in a translation. He then devoured all the
French books he found in his father&rsquo;s library.
Pushkin was gifted with a photographic memory,
which retained what he read immediately
and permanently. His first efforts at writing
were in French,&mdash;comedies, which he performed
himself to an audience of his sisters.
He went to school in 1812 at the Lyceum of
Tsarskoe Selo, a suburb of St. Petersburg. His
school career was not brilliant, and his leaving
certificate qualifies his achievements as
mediocre, even in Russian. But during the
six years he spent at the Lyceum, he continued
to read voraciously. His favourite poet at
this time was Voltaire. He began to write
verse, first in French and then in Russian;
some of it was printed in 1814 and 1815 in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
reviews, and in 1815 he declaimed his <i>Recollections
of Tsarskoe Selo</i> in public at the
Lyceum examination, in the presence of
Derzhavin the poet.</p>

<p>The poems which he wrote at school afterwards
formed part of his collected works. In
these poems, consisting for the greater part of
anacreontics and epistles, although they are
immature, and imitative, partly of contemporary
authors such as Derzhavin and Zhukovsky,
and partly of the French anacreontic
school of poets, such as Voltaire, Gresset and
Parny, the sound of a new voice was unmistakable.
Indeed, not only his contemporaries,
but the foremost representatives of the
Russian literature of that day, Derzhavin,
Karamzin and Zhukovsky, made no mistake
about it. They greeted the first notes of this
new lyre with enthusiasm. Zhukovsky used
to visit the boy poet at school and read out
his verse to him. Derzhavin was enthusiastic
over the recitation of his <i>Recollections of
Tsarskoe Selo</i>. Thus fame came to Pushkin
as easily as the gift of writing verse. He had
lisped in numbers, and as soon as he began
to speak in them, his contemporaries immediately
recognized and hailed the new voice.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>57]</a></span>
He did not wake up and find himself famous
like Byron, but he walked into the Hall of
Fame as naturally as a young heir steps into
his lawful inheritance. If we compare
Pushkin&rsquo;s school-boy poetry with Byron&rsquo;s
<i>Hours of Idleness</i>, it is easy to understand
how this came about. In the <i>Hours of
Idleness</i> there is, perhaps, only one poem
which would hold out hopes of serious promise;
and the most discerning critics would
have been justified in being careful before
venturing to stake any great hopes on so
slender a hint. But in Pushkin&rsquo;s early verse,
although the subject-matter is borrowed,
and the style is still irregular and careless,
it is none the less obvious that it flows
from the pen of the author without effort
or strain; and besides this, certain coins of
genuine poetry ring out, bearing the image
and superscription of a new mint, the mint of
Pushkin.</p>

<p>When the first of his poems to attract the
attention of a larger audience, <i>Ruslan and
Ludmila</i>, was published, in 1820, it was
greeted with enthusiasm by the public; but
it had already won the suffrages of that
circle which counted most, that is to say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>58]</a></span>
the leading men of letters of the day, who
had heard it read out in MSS. For as soon
as Pushkin left school and stepped into the
world, he was received into the literary circle
of the day on equal terms. After he had read
aloud the first cantos of <i>Ruslan and Ludmila</i>
at Zhukovsky&rsquo;s literary evenings, Zhukovsky
gave him his portrait with this inscription:
&ldquo;To the pupil, from his defeated master&rdquo;;
and <span class="smcap">Batyushkov</span>, a poet who, after having
been influenced, like Pushkin, by Voltaire and
Parny, had gone back to the classics, Horace
and Tibullus, and had introduced the classic
anacreontic school of poetry into Russia, was
astonished to find a young man of the world
outplaying him without any trouble on the
same lyre, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! how well
the rascal has started writing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The publication of <i>Ruslan and Ludmila</i>
sealed Pushkin&rsquo;s reputation definitely, as far
as the general public was concerned, although
some of the professional critics treated the
poem with severity. The subject of the poem
was a Russian fairy-tale, and the critics blamed
the poet for having recourse to what they
called Russian folk-lore, which they considered
to be unworthy of the poetic muse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>59]</a></span>
One review complained that Pushkin&rsquo;s choice
of subject was like introducing a bearded
unkempt peasant into a drawing-room, while
others blamed him for dealing with national
stuff in a flippant spirit. But the curious
thing is that, while the critics blamed him
for his choice of subject, and his friends and
the public defended him for it, quoting all
sorts of precedents, the poem has absolutely
nothing in common, either in its spirit, style
or characterization, with native Russian
folk-lore and fairy-tales. Much later on in
his career, Pushkin was to show what he
could do with Russian folk-lore. But <i>Ruslan
and Ludmila</i>, which, as far as its form is concerned,
has a certain superficial resemblance
to Ariosto, is in reality the result of the
French influence, under which Pushkin had
been ever since his cradle, and which in this
poem blazes into the sky like a rocket, and
bursts into a shower of sparks, never to
return again.</p>

<p>There is no passion in the poem and no
irony, but it is young, fresh, full of sensuous,
not to say sensual images, interruptions,
digressions, and flippant epigrams. Pushkin
wondered afterwards that nobody noticed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>60]</a></span>
the coldness of the poem; the truth was that
the eyes of the public were dazzled by the
fresh sensuous images, and their ears were
taken captive by the new voice: for the importance
of the poem lies in this&mdash;that the
new voice which the literary pundits had
already recognized in the Lyceum of Tsarskoe
Selo was now speaking to the whole world,
and all Russia became aware that a young
man was among them &ldquo;with mouth of gold
and morning in his eyes.&rdquo; <i>Ruslan and
Ludmila</i> has just the same sensuous richness,
fresh music and fundamental coldness as
Marlowe&rsquo;s <i>Hero and Leander</i>. After finishing
the poem, Pushkin added a magnificent and
moving Epilogue, written from the Caucasus
in the year of its publication (1820); and when
the second edition was published in 1828, he
added a Prologue in his finest manner which
tells of Russian fairy-land.</p>

<p>After leaving school in 1817, until 1820,
Pushkin plunged into the gay life of St.
Petersburg. He wanted to be a Hussar, but
his father could not afford it. In default
he became a Foreign Office official; but he did
not take this profession seriously. He consorted
with the political youth and young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>61]</a></span>
Liberals of the day; he scattered stinging
epigrams and satirical epistles broadcast.
He sympathized with the Decembrists, but
took no part in their conspiracy. He would
probably have ended by doing so; but, luckily
for Russian literature, he was transferred in
1820 from the Foreign Office to the Chancery
of General Inzov in the South of Russia;
and from 1820 to 1826 he lived first at Kishinev,
then at Odessa, and finally in his own
home at Pskov. This enforced banishment
was of the greatest possible service to the
poet; it took him away from the whirl and
distractions of St. Petersburg; it prevented
him from being compromised in the drama
of the Decembrists; it ripened and matured
his poetical genius; it provided him, since it
was now that he visited the Caucasus and the
Crimea for the first time, with new subject-matter.</p>

<p>During this period he learnt Italian and
English, and came under the influence of
Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier and Byron. Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier&rsquo;s
influence is strongly felt in a series of lyrics
in imitation of the classics; but these
lyrics were altogether different from the
anacreontics of his boyhood. Byron&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>62]</a></span>
influence is first manifested in a long poem
<i>The Prisoner of the Caucasus</i>. It is Byronic
in the temperament of the hero, who talks in
the strain of the earlier Childe Harold; he is
young, but feels old; tired of life, he seeks for
consolation in the loneliness of nature in the
Caucasus. He is taken prisoner by mountain
tribesmen, and set free by a girl who
drowns herself on account of her unrequited
love. Pushkin said later that the poem was
immature, but that there were verses in it
that came from his heart. There is one
element in the poem which is by no means
immature, and that is the picture of the
Caucasus, which is executed with much
reality and simplicity. Pushkin annexed the
Caucasus to Russian poetry. The Crimea
inspired him with another tale, also Byronic
in some respects, <i>The Fountain of Baghchi-Sarai</i>,
which tells of a Tartar Khan and his
Christian slave, who is murdered out of
jealousy by a former favourite, herself drowned
by the orders of the Khan. Here again the
descriptions are amazing, and Pushkin draws
out a new stop of rich and voluptuous music.</p>

<p>In speaking of the influence of Byron over
Pushkin it is necessary to discriminate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>63]</a></span>
Byron helped Pushkin to discover himself;
Byron revealed to him his own powers,
showed him the way out of the French
garden where he had been dwelling, and acted
as a guide to fresh woods and pastures new.
But what Pushkin took from the new provinces
to which the example of Byron led him was
entirely different from what Byron sought
there. Again, the methods and workmanship
of the two poets were radically different.
Pushkin is never imitative of Byron; but
Byron opened his eyes to a new world,
and indeed did for him what Chapman&rsquo;s
<i>Homer</i> did for Keats. It frequently happens
that when a poet is deeply struck by the
work of another poet he feels a desire to
write something himself, but something different.
Thus Pushkin&rsquo;s mental intercourse
with Byron had the effect of bracing the
talent of the Russian poet and spurring him
on to the conquest of new worlds.</p>

<p>Pushkin&rsquo;s six years&rsquo; banishment to his own
country had the effect of revealing to him
the reality and seriousness of his vocation
as a poet, and the range and strength of his
gifts. It was during this period that besides
the works already mentioned he wrote some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>64]</a></span>
of his finest lyrics, <i>The Conversation between
the Bookseller and the Poet</i>&mdash;perhaps the most
perfect of his shorter poems&mdash;it contains four
lines to have written which Turgenev said he
would have burnt the whole of his works&mdash;a
larger poem called <i>The Gypsies</i>; his dramatic
chronicle <i>Boris Godunov</i>, and the beginning
of his masterpiece <i>Onegin</i>; several ballads,
including <i>The Sage Oleg</i>, and an unfinished
romance, the <i>Robber Brothers</i>.</p>

<p>Not only is the richness of his output
during this period remarkable, but the variety
and the high level of art maintained in all
the different styles which he attempted and
mastered. <i>The Gypsies</i> (1827), which was
received with greater favour by the public
than any of his poems, either earlier or later,
is the story of a disappointed man, Aleko,
who leaves the world and takes refuge with
gypsies. A tragically ironical situation is the
result. The anarchic nature of the Byronic
misanthrope brings tragedy into the peaceful
life of the people, who are lawless because
they need no laws. Aleko loves and marries
the gypsy Zemfira, but after a time she tires
of him, and loves a young gypsy. Aleko
surprises them and kills them both. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>65]</a></span>
Zemfira&rsquo;s father banishes him from the
gypsies&rsquo; camp. He, too, had been deceived.
When his wife Mariula had been untrue and
had left him, he had attempted no vengeance,
but had brought up her daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave us, proud man,&rdquo; he says to Aleko.
&ldquo;We are a wild people; we have no laws,
we torture not, neither do we punish; we
have no use for blood or groans; we will not
live with a man of blood. Thou wast not
made for the wild life. For thyself alone
thou claimest licence; we are shy and good-natured;
thou art evil-minded and presumptuous.
Farewell, and peace be with thee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The charm of the poem lies in the descriptions
of the gypsy camp and the gypsy life,
the snatches of gypsy song, and the characterization
of the gypsies, especially of the women.
It is not surprising the poem was popular; it
breathes a spell, and the reading of it conjures
up before one the wandering life, the camp-fire,
the soft speech and the song; and makes
one long to go off with &ldquo;the raggle-taggle
gypsies O!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Byron&rsquo;s influence soon gave way to that
of Shakespeare, who opened a still larger
field of vision to the Russian poet. In 1825
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>66]</a></span>
he writes: &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Quel homme que ce Shakespeare!
Je n&rsquo;en reviens pas. Comme Byron le tragique
est mesquin devant lui! Ce Byron qui
n&rsquo;a jamais con&ccedil;u qu&rsquo;un seul caract&egrave;re et c&rsquo;est
le sien ... ce Byron donc a partag&eacute; entre
ses personages tel et tel trait de son caract&egrave;re:
son orgeuil &agrave; l&rsquo;un, sa haine &agrave; l&rsquo;autre,
sa m&eacute;lancolie au troisi&egrave;me, etc., et c&rsquo;est
ainsi d&rsquo;un caract&egrave;re plein, sombre et &eacute;nergique,
il a fait plusieurs caract&egrave;res insignifiants; ce
n&rsquo;est pas l&agrave; de la trag&eacute;die. On a encore une
manie. Quand on a con&ccedil;u un caract&egrave;re, tout
ce qu&rsquo;on lui fait dire, m&ecirc;me les choses les plus
&eacute;tranges, en porte essentiellement l&rsquo;empreinte,
comme les p&eacute;dants et les marins dans les
vieux romans de Fielding. Voyez le haineux
de Byron ... et l&agrave;-dessus lisez Shakespeare.
Il ne craint jamais de compromettre son
personage, il le fait parler avec tout l&rsquo;abandon
de la vie, car il est s&ucirc;r en temps et lieu, de
lui faire trouver le langage de son caract&egrave;re.
Vous me demanderez: votre trag&eacute;die est-elle
une trag&eacute;die de caract&egrave;re ou de costume?
J&rsquo;ai choisi le genre le plus ais&eacute;, mais j&rsquo;ai t&acirc;ch&eacute;
de les unir tous deux. J&rsquo;&eacute;cris et je pense. La
plupart des sc&egrave;nes ne demandent que du
raisonnement; quand j&rsquo;arrive &agrave; une sc&egrave;ne qui
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>67]</a></span>
demande de l&rsquo;inspiration, j&rsquo;attends ou je
passe dessus.</span>&rdquo;</p>

<p>I quote this letter because it throws light,
firstly, on Pushkin&rsquo;s matured opinion of
Byron, and, secondly, on his methods of
work; for, like Leonardo da Vinci, he formed
the habit, which he here describes, of leaving
unwritten passages where inspiration was
needed, until he felt the moment of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bien
&ecirc;tre</i> when inspiration came; and this not
only in writing his tragedy, but henceforward
in everything that he wrote, as his note-books
testify.</p>

<p>The subject-matter of <i>Boris Godunov</i> was
based on Karamzin&rsquo;s history: it deals with
the dramatic episode of the Russian Perkin
Warbeck, the false Demetrius who pretended
to be the murdered son of Ivan the Terrible.
The play is constructed on the model of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s chronicle plays, but in a still
more disjointed fashion, without a definite
beginning or end: when Mussorgsky made an
opera out of it, the action was concentrated
into definite acts; for, as it stands, it is not
a play, but a series of scenes. Pushkin had
not the power of conceiving and executing
a drama which should move round one idea to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>68]</a></span>
an inevitable close. He had not the gift
of dramatic architectonics, and still less that
of stage carpentry. On the other hand, the
scenes, whether they be tragic and poetical,
or scenes of common life, are as vivid as any
in Shakespeare; the characters are all alive,
and they speak a language which is at the
same time ancient, living, and convincing.</p>

<p>In saying that Pushkin lacks the gift of
stage architectonics and stage carpentry, it
is not merely meant that he lacked the gift
of arranging acts that would suit the stage,
or that of imagining stage effects. His whole
play is not conceived as a drama; a subject
from which a drama might be written is taken,
but the drama is left unwritten. We see
Boris Godunov on the throne, which he has
unlawfully usurped; we know he feels remorse;
he tells us so in monologues; we see his soul
stripped before us, bound upon a wheel of
fire, and we watch the wheel revolve; and
that is all the moral and spiritual action that
the part contains; he is static and not dynamic,
he never has to make up his mind; his will
never has to encounter the shock of another
will during the whole play. Neither does the
chronicle centre round the Pretender. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>69]</a></span>
true that we see the idea of impersonating
the Tsarevitch dawning in his mind;
and it is also true that in one scene with his
Polish love, Marina, we see him dynamically
moving in a dramatic situation. She loves him
because she thinks he is the son of an anointed
King. He loves her too much to deceive her,
and tells her the truth. She then says she
will have nothing of him; and then he rises
from defeat and shame to the height of the
situation, becomes great, and, not unlike
Browning&rsquo;s Sludge, says: &ldquo;Although I am
an impostor, I am born to be a King all the
same; I am one of Nature&rsquo;s Kings; and I
defy you to oust me from the situation. Tell
every one what I have told you. Nobody will
believe you.&rdquo; And Marina is conquered once
more by his conduct and bearing.</p>

<p>This scene is sheer drama; it is the conflict
of two wills and two souls. But there the
matter ends. The kaleidoscope is shaken,
and we are shown a series of different patterns,
in which the heroine plays no part at all, and
in which the hero only makes a momentary
appearance. The fact is there is neither hero
nor heroine in the play. It is not a play, but
a chronicle; and it would be foolish to blame
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>70]</a></span>
Pushkin for not accomplishing what he never
attempted. As a chronicle, a series of detached
scenes, it is supremely successful.
There are certain scenes which attain to
sublimity: for instance, that in the cell of
the monastery, where the monk is finishing
his chronicle; and the monologue in which
Boris speaks his remorse, and his dying
speech to his son. The verse in these scenes
is sealed with the mark of that God-gifted
ease and high seriousness, which belong only
to the inspired great. They are Shakespearean,
not because they imitate Shakespeare,
but because they attain to heights of imaginative
truth to which Shakespeare rises more
often than any other poet; and the language
in these scenes has a simplicity, an inevitableness,
an absence of all conscious effort and of
all visible art and artifice, a closeness of
utterance combined with a width of suggestion
which belong only to the greatest artists, to
the Greeks, to Shakespeare, to Dante.</p>

<p><i>Boris Godunov</i> was not published until
January 1, 1831, and passed, with one
exception, absolutely unnoticed by the critics.
Like so many great works, it came before its
time; and it was not until years afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>71]</a></span>
that the merits of this masterpiece were
understood and appreciated.</p>

<p>In 1826 Pushkin&rsquo;s banishment to the
country came to an end; in that year he was
allowed to go to Moscow, and in 1827 to St.
Petersburg. In 1826 his poems appeared in
one volume, and the second canto of <i>Onegin</i>
(the first had appeared in 1825). In 1827
<i>The Gypsies</i>, and the third canto of <i>Onegin</i>;
in 1828 the fourth, fifth, and sixth cantos of
<i>Onegin</i>; in 1829 <i>Graf Nulin</i>, an admirably
told <i>Conte</i> such as Maupassant might have
written, of a deceived husband and a wife who,
finding herself in the situation of Lucretia,
gives the would-be Tarquin a box on the
ears, but succeeds, nevertheless, in being unfaithful
with some one else&mdash;the <i>Cottage of
Kolomna</i> is another story in the same vein&mdash;and
in the same year <i>Poltava</i>.</p>

<p>This poem was written in one month,
in St. Petersburg. The subject is Mazepa,
with whom the daughter of his hereditary
enemy, Kochubey, whom he afterwards tortures
and kills, falls in love. But it is in
reality the epic of Peter the Great.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> When
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>72]</a></span>
the poem was published, it disconcerted the
critics and the public. It revealed an entirely
new phase of Pushkin&rsquo;s style, and it
should have widened the popular conception
of the poet&rsquo;s powers and versatility. But at
the time the public only knew Pushkin
through his lyrics and his early tales; <i>Boris
Godunov</i> had not yet been published; moreover,
the public of that day expected to find
in a poem passion and the delineation of
the heart&rsquo;s adventures. This stern objective
fragment of an epic, falling into their sentimental
world of keepsakes, ribbons, roses and
cupids, like a bas-relief conceived by a Titan
and executed by a god, met with little appreciation.
The poet&rsquo;s verse which, so far as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>73]</a></span>
public knew it, had hitherto seemed like
a shining and luscious fruit, was exchanged
for a concentrated weighty tramp of ringing
rhyme, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">martel&eacute;</i> like steel. It is as if Tennyson
had followed up his early poems in a style
as concise as that of Pope and as concentrated
as that of Browning&rsquo;s dramatic lyrics. The
poem is a fit monument to Peter the Great,
and the great monarch&rsquo;s impetuous genius
and passion for thorough craftsmanship seem
to have entered into it.</p>

<p>In 1829 Pushkin made a second journey to
the Caucasus, the result of which was a
harvest of lyrics. On his return to St.
Petersburg he sketched the plan of another
epic poem, <i>Galub</i>, dealing with the Caucasus,
but this remained a fragment.</p>

<p>In 1831 he finished the eighth and last
canto of <i>Onegin</i>. Originally there were nine
cantos, but when the work was published one
of the cantos dealing with Onegin&rsquo;s travels
was left out as being irrelevant. Pushkin
had worked at this poem since 1823. It
was Byron&rsquo;s <i>Beppo</i> which gave him the
idea of writing a poem on modern life; but
here again, he made of the idea something
quite different from any of Byron&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>74]</a></span>
work. <i>Onegin</i> is a novel. Eugene Onegin
is the name of the hero. It is, moreover,
the first Russian novel; and as a novel it
has never been surpassed. It is as real as
Tolstoy, as finished in workmanship and
construction as Turgenev. It is a realistic
novel; not realistic in the sense that Zola&rsquo;s
work was mis-called realistic, but realistic in
the sense that Miss Austen is realistic. The
hero is the average man about St. Petersburg;
his father, a worthy public servant, lives
honourably on debts and gives three balls a
year. Onegin is brought up, not too strictly,
by &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur l&rsquo;Abb&eacute;</span>&rdquo;; he goes out in the
world clothed by a London tailor, fluent in
French, and able to dance the Mazurka.</p>

<p>Onegin can touch on every subject, can
hold his tongue when the conversation becomes
too serious, and make epigrams. He knows
enough Latin to construe an epitaph, to talk
about Juvenal, and put &ldquo;Vale!&rdquo; at the end
of his letters, and he can remember two lines
of the <i>&AElig;neid</i>. He is severe on Homer and
Theocritus, but has read Adam Smith. The
only art in which he is proficient is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ars
amandi</i> as taught by Ovid. He is a patron
of the ballet; he goes to balls; he eats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>75]</a></span>
beef-steaks and <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pat&eacute; de foie gras</i>. In spite of all
this&mdash;perhaps because of it&mdash;he suffers from
spleen, like Childe Harold, the author says.
His father dies, leaving a lot of debts behind
him, but a dying uncle summons him to the
country; and when he gets there he finds his
uncle dead, and himself the inheritor of the
estate. In the country, he is just as much
bored as he was in St. Petersburg. A new
neighbour arrives in the shape of Lensky, a
young man fresh from Germany, an enthusiast
and a poet, and full of Kant, Schiller,
and the German writers. Lensky introduces
Onegin to the neighbouring family, by name
Larin, consisting of a widow and two daughters.
Lensky is in love with the younger daughter,
Olga, who is simple, fresh, blue-eyed, with a
round face, as Onegin says, like the foolish
moon. The elder sister, Tatiana, is less
pretty; shy and dreamy, she conceals under
her retiring and wistful ways a clean-cut
character and a strong will.</p>

<p>Tatiana is as real as any of Miss Austen&rsquo;s
heroines; as alive as Fielding&rsquo;s Sophia Western,
and as charming as any of George Meredith&rsquo;s
women; as sensible as Portia, as resolute as
Juliet. Turgenev, with all his magic, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>76]</a></span>
Tolstoy, with all his command over the colours
of life, never created a truer, more radiant,
and more typically Russian woman. She is
the type of all that is best in the Russian
woman; that is to say, of all that is best in
Russia; and it is a type taken straight from
life, and not from fairy-land&mdash;a type that
exists as much to-day as it did in the days
of Pushkin. She is the first of that long
gallery of Russian women which Turgenev,
Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky have given us, and
which are the most precious jewels of Russian
literature, because they reflect the crowning
glory of Russian life. Tatiana falls in love
with Onegin at first sight. She writes to him
and confesses her love, and in all the love
poetry of the world there is nothing more
touching and more simple than this confession.
It is perfect. If Pushkin had written this and
this alone, his place among poets would be
unique and different from that of all other
poets.</p>

<p>Possibly some people may think that there
are finer achievements in the love poetry of
the world; but nothing is so futile and so
impertinent as giving marks to the great
poets, as if they were passing an examination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>77]</a></span>
If a thing is as good as possible in itself, what
is the use of saying that it is less good or
better than something else, which is as good
as possible in itself also. Nevertheless, placed
beside any of the great confessions of love in
poetry&mdash;Francesca&rsquo;s story in the <i>Inferno</i>,
Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s leavetaking, Ph&egrave;dre&rsquo;s
declaration, Don Juan Tenorio&rsquo;s letter&mdash;the
beauty of Tatiana&rsquo;s confession would not be
diminished by the juxtaposition. Of the rest
of Pushkin&rsquo;s work at its best and highest, of
the finest passages of <i>Boris Godunov</i>, for
instance, you can say: This is magnificent,
but there are dramatic passages in other
works of other poets on the same lines and
as fine; but in Tatiana&rsquo;s letter Pushkin has
created something unique, which has no
parallel, because only a Russian could have
written it, and of Russians, only he. It is
a piece of poetry as pure as a crystal, as
spontaneous as a blackbird&rsquo;s song.</p>

<p>Onegin tells Tatiana he is not worthy of
her, that he is not made for love and marriage;
that he would cease to love her at once; that
he feels for her like a brother, or perhaps a
little more tenderly. It then falls out that
Onegin, by flirting with Olga at a ball, makes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>78]</a></span>
Lensky jealous. They fight a duel, and
Lensky is killed. Onegin is obliged to leave
the neighbourhood, and spends years in travel.
Tatiana remains true to her first love; but she
is taken by her relatives to Moscow, and
consents at last under their pressure to marry
a rich man of great position. In St. Petersburg,
Onegin meets her again. Tatiana has
become a great lady, but all her old charm
is there. Onegin now falls violently in love
with her; but she, although she frankly confesses
that she still loves him, tells him that
it is too late; she has married another, and
she means to remain true to him. And there
the story ends.</p>

<p><i>Onegin</i> is, perhaps, Pushkin&rsquo;s most characteristic
work; it is undoubtedly the best
known and the most popular; like <i>Hamlet</i>,
it is all quotations. Pushkin in his <i>Onegin</i>
succeeded in doing what Shelley urged
Byron to do&mdash;to create something new
and in accordance with the spirit of the age,
which should at the same time be beautiful.
He did more than this. He succeeded
in creating for Russia a poem that was purely
national, and in giving his country a classic,
a model both in construction, matter, form,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>79]</a></span>
and inspiration for future generations. Perhaps
the greatest quality of this poem is its
vividness. Pushkin himself speaks, in taking
leave, of having seen the unfettered march
of his novel in a magic prism. This is just
the impression that the poem gives; the scenes
are as clear as the shapes in a crystal; nothing
is blurred; there are no hesitating notes, nothing
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">&agrave; peu pr&egrave;s</i>; every stroke comes off; the nail
is hit on the head every time, only so easily
that you do not notice the strokes, and all
labour escapes notice. Apart from this the
poem is amusing; it arrests the attention as
a story, and it delights the intelligence with
its wit, its digressions, and its brilliance. It
is as witty as Don Juan and as consummately
expressed as Pope; and when the occasion
demands it, the style passes in easy transition
to serious or tender tones. <i>Onegin</i> has been
compared to Byron&rsquo;s <i>Don Juan</i>. There is
this likeness, that both poems deal with
contemporary life, and in both poems the
poets pass from grave to gay, from severe to
lively, and often interrupt the narrative to
apostrophize the reader. But there the likeness
ends. On the other hand, there is a
vast difference. <i>Onegin</i> contains no adventures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>80]</a></span>
It is a story of everyday life. Moreover,
it is an organic whole: so well constructed
that it fits into a stage libretto&mdash;Tchaikovsky
made an opera out of it&mdash;without difficulty.
There is another difference&mdash;a difference
which applies to Pushkin and Byron in
general. There is no unevenness in Pushkin;
his work, as far as craft is concerned, is always
on the same high level. You can admire the
whole, or cut off any single passage and it
will still remain admirable; whereas Byron
must be taken as a whole or not at all&mdash;the
reason being that Pushkin was an impeccable
artist in form and expression, and that Byron
was not.</p>

<p>In the winter of 1832 Pushkin sought a
new field, the field of historical research; and
by the beginning of 1833 he had not only
collected all the materials for a history of
Pugachev, the Cossack who headed a rising
in the reign of Catherine II; but his literary
activity was so great that he had also written
the rough sketch of a long story in prose dealing
with the same subject, <i>The Captain&rsquo;s Daughter</i>,
another prose story of considerable length,
<i>Dubrovsky</i>, and portions of a drama, <i>Rusalka</i>,
The Water Nymph, which was never finished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>81]</a></span>
Besides <i>Boris Godunov</i> and the <i>Rusalka</i>,
Pushkin wrote a certain number of dramatic
scenes, or short dramas in one or more scenes.
Of these, one, <i>The Feast in the Time of Plague</i>,
is taken from the English of John Wilson (<i>The
City of the Plague</i>), with original additions.
In <i>Mozart and Salieri</i> we see the contrast
between the genius which does what it must
and the talent which does what it can. The
story is based on the unfounded anecdote
that Mozart was poisoned by Salieri out of
envy. This dramatic and beautifully written
episode has been set to music as it stands by
Rimsky-Korsakov.</p>

<p><i>The Covetous Knight</i>, which bears the
superscription, &ldquo;From the tragi-comedy of
Chenstone&rdquo;&mdash;an unknown English original&mdash;tells
of the conflict between a Harpagon and
his son: the delineation of the miser&rsquo;s imaginative
passion for his treasures is, both in
conception and execution, in Pushkin&rsquo;s finest
manner. This scene has been recently set to
music by Rakhmaninov. <i>The Guest of Stone</i>,
the story of Don Juan and the <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">statua gentilissima
del gran Commendatore</i>, makes Don
Juan life. A scene from <i>Faust</i> between
Faust and Mephistopheles is original and not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>82]</a></span>
of great interest; <i>Angelo</i> is the story of
<i>Measure for Measure</i> told as a narrative with
two scenes in dialogue. <i>Rusalka</i>, The Water
Maid, is taken from the genuine and not the
sham province of national legend, and it is
tantalizing that this poetic fragment remained
a fragment.</p>

<p>Pushkin&rsquo;s prose is in some respects as
remarkable as his verse. Here, too, he
proved a pioneer. <i>Dubrovsky</i> is the story of
a young officer whose father is ousted, like
Naboth, from his small estate by his neighbour,
a rich and greedy landed proprietor,
becomes a highway robber so as to revenge
himself, and introduces himself into the family
of his enemy as a French master, but forgoes
his revenge because he falls in love with his
enemy&rsquo;s daughter. In this extremely vivid
story he anticipates Gogol in his lifelike
pictures of country life. <i>The Captain&rsquo;s
Daughter</i> is equally vivid; the rebel Pugachev
has nothing stagey or melodramatic about
him, nothing of Harrison Ainsworth. Of his
shorter stories, such as <i>The Blizzard</i>, <i>The
Pistol Shot</i>, <i>The Lady-Peasant</i>, the most
entertaining, and certainly the most popular,
is <i>The Queen of Spades</i>, which was so admirably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>83]</a></span>
translated by M&eacute;rim&eacute;e, and formed the subject
of one of Tchaikovsky&rsquo;s most successful
operas. As an artistic work <i>The Egyptian
Nights</i>, written in 1828, is the most interesting,
and ranks among Pushkin&rsquo;s masterpieces. It
tells of an Italian <i>improvisatore</i> who, at a
party in St. Petersburg, improvises verses on
Cleopatra and her lovers. The story is
written to lead up to this poem, which gives
a gorgeous picture of the pagan world, and
is another example of Pushkin&rsquo;s miraculous
power of assimilation. Pushkin&rsquo;s prose has
the same limpidity and ease as his verse; the
characters have the same vitality and reality
as those in his poems and dramatic scenes,
and had he lived longer he might have
become a great novelist. As it is, he furnished
Gogol (whose acquaintance he made
in 1832) with the subject of two of his masterpieces&mdash;<i>Dead
Souls</i> and <i>The Revisor</i>.</p>

<p>The province of Russian folk-lore and
legend from which Pushkin took the idea of
<i>Rusalka</i> was to furnish him with a great
deal of rich material. It was in 1831 that
in friendly rivalry with Zhukovsky he wrote
his first long fairy-tale, imitating the Russian
popular style, <i>The Tale of Tsar Saltan</i>. Up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>84]</a></span>
till now he had written only a few ballads
in the popular style. This fairy-tale was a
brilliant success as a <i>pastiche</i>; but it was a
<i>pastiche</i> and not quite the real thing, as
cleverness kept breaking in, and a touch of
epigram here and there, which indeed makes
it delightful reading. He followed it by another
in the comic vein, <i>The Tale of the Pope and
his Man Balda</i>, and by two more <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">M&auml;rchen</i>,
<i>The Dead Tsaritsa</i> and <i>The Golden Cock</i>; but
it was not until two years later that he wrote
his masterpiece in this vein, <i>The Story of the
Fisherman and the Fish</i>. It is the same
story as Grimm&rsquo;s tale of the Fisherman&rsquo;s
wife who wished to be King, Emperor, and
then Pope, and finally lost all by her vaulting
ambition. The tale is written in unrhymed
rhythmical, indeed scarcely rhythmical, lines;
all trace of art is concealed; it is a tale such
as might have been handed down by oral
tradition in some obscure village out of the
remotest past; it has the real <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkston</i>; the
good-nature and simplicity and unobtrusive
humour of a real fairy-tale. The subjects of
all these stories were told to Pushkin by his
nurse, Anna Rodionovna, who also furnished
him with the subject of his ballad, <i>The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>85]</a></span>
Bridegroom</i>. In Pushkin&rsquo;s note-books there
are seven fairy-tales taken down hurriedly
from the words of his nurse; and most likely
all that he wrote dealing with the life of the
people came from the same source. Pushkin
called Anna Rodionovna his last teacher,
and said that he was indebted to her for
counteracting the effects of his first French
education.</p>

<p>In 1833 he finished a poem called <i>The
Brazen Horseman</i>, the story of a man who
loses his beloved in the great floods in St.
Petersburg in 1834, and going mad, imagines
that he is pursued by Falconet&rsquo;s equestrian
statue of Peter the Great. The poem contains
a magnificent description of St. Petersburg.
During the last years of his life, he was
engaged in collecting materials for a history
of Peter the Great. His power of production
had never run dry from the moment he left
school, although his actual work was interrupted
from time to time by distractions and
the society of his friends.</p>

<p>All the important larger works of Pushkin
have now been mentioned; but during the
whole course of his career he was always
pouring out a stream of lyrics and occasional
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>86]</a></span>
pieces, many of which are among the most
beautiful things he wrote. His variety and
the width of his range are astonishing. Some
of them have a grace and perfection such as
we find in the Greek anthology; others&mdash;&ldquo;Recollections,&rdquo;
for instance, in which in the
sleepless hours of the night the poet sees pass
before him the blotted scroll of his past deeds,
which he is powerless with all the tears in the
world to wash out&mdash;have the intensity of
Shakespeare&rsquo;s sonnets. This poem, for instance,
has the same depth of feeling as
&ldquo;Tired with all these, for restful death I
cry,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The expense of spirit in a waste
of shame.&rdquo; Or he will write an elegy as
tender as Tennyson; or he will draw a picture
of a sledge in a snow-storm, and give you the
plunge of the bewildered horses, the whirling
demons of the storm, the bells ringing on the
quiet spaces of snow, in intoxicating rhythms
which E.&nbsp;A. Poe would have envied; or again
he will write a description of the Caucasus
in eleven short lines, close in expression and
vast in suggestion, such as &ldquo;The Monastery
on Kazbek&rdquo;; or he will bring before you the
smell of the autumn morning, and the hoofs
ringing out on the half-frozen earth; or he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>87]</a></span>
will write a patriotic poem, such as <i>To the
Slanderers of Russia</i>, fraught with patriotic
indignation without being offensive; in this
poem Pushkin paints an inspired picture of
Russia: &ldquo;Will not,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;from Perm to
the Caucasus, from Finland&rsquo;s chill rocks to the
flaming Colchis, from the shaken Kremlin to
the unshaken walls of China, glistening with
its bristling steel, the Russian earth arise?&rdquo;
Or he will write a prayer, as lordly in utterance
and as humble in spirit as one of the old
Latin hymns; or a love-poem as tender as
Musset and as playful as Heine: he will
translate you the spirit of Horace and the
spirit of Mickiewicz the Pole; he will secure
the restraint of Andr&eacute; Ch&eacute;nier, and the
impetuous gallop of Byron.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most characteristic of Pushkin&rsquo;s
poems is the poem which expresses his view
of life in the elegy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;As bitter as stale aftermath of wine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is the remembrance of delirious days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as wine waxes with the years, so weighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The past more sorely, as my days decline.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My path is dark. The future lies in wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gathering ocean of anxiety,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oh! my friends! to suffer, to create,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>88]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That is my prayer; to live and not to die!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know that ecstasy shall still lie there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sorrow and adversity and care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more I shall be drunk on strains divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be moved to tears by musings that are mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haply when the last sad hour draws nigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love with a farewell smile shall light the sky.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the greatest of his short poems is probably
&ldquo;The Prophet.&rdquo; This is a tremendous
poem, and reaches a height to which Pushkin
only attained once. It is Miltonic in conception
and Dantesque in expression; the syllables
ring out in pure concent, like blasts from a
silver clarion. It is, as it were, the Pillars of
Hercules of the Russian language. Nothing
finer as sound could ever be compounded
with Russian vowels and consonants; nothing
could be more perfectly planned, or present,
in so small a vehicle, so large a vision to the
imagination. Even a rough prose translation
will give some idea of the imaginative splendour
of the poem&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
&ldquo;My spirit was weary, and I was athirst,
and I was astray in the dark wilderness.
And the Seraphim with six wings appeared
to me at the crossing of the ways: And he
touched my eyelids, and his fingers were as
soft as sleep: and like the eyes of an eagle
that is frightened my prophetic eyes were
awakened. He touched my ears and he filled
them with noise and with sound: and I
heard the Heavens shuddering and the
flight of the angels in the height, and the
moving of the beasts that are under the
waters, and the noise of the growth of the
branches in the valley. He bent down over
me and he looked upon my lips; and he tore
out my sinful tongue, and he took away that
which is idle and that which is evil with his
right hand, and his right hand was dabbled
with blood; and he set there in its stead,
between my perishing lips, the tongue of a
wise serpent. And he clove my breast asunder
with a sword, and he plucked out my trembling
heart, and in my cloven breast he set
a burning coal of fire. Like a corpse in the
desert I lay, and the voice of God called
and said unto me, &lsquo;Prophet, arise, and take
heed, and hear; be filled with My will, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>90]</a></span>
go forth over the sea and over the land and
set light with My word to the hearts of the
people.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 1837 came the catastrophe which brought
about Pushkin&rsquo;s death. It was caused by
the clash of evil tongues engaged in frivolous
gossip, and Pushkin&rsquo;s own susceptible and violent
temperament. A guardsman, Heckeren-Dantes,
had been flirting with his wife.
Pushkin received an anonymous letter, and
being wrongly convinced that Heckeren-Dantes
was the author of it, wrote him a
violent letter which made a duel inevitable.
A duel was fought on the 27th of February,
1837, and Pushkin was mortally wounded.
Such was his frenzy of rage that, after lying
wounded and unconscious in the snow, on
regaining consciousness, he insisted on going on
with the duel, and fired another shot, giving a
great cry of joy when he saw that he had
wounded his adversary. It was only a slight
wound in the hand. It was not until he reached
home that his anger passed away. He died
on the 29th of February, after forty-five hours
of excruciating suffering, heroically borne;
he forgave his enemies; he wished no one to
avenge him; he received the last sacraments;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>91]</a></span>
and he expressed feelings of loyalty and
gratitude to his sovereign. He was thirty-seven
years and eight months old.</p>

<p>Pushkin&rsquo;s career falls naturally into two
divisions: his life until he was thirty, and
his life after he was thirty. Pushkin began
his career with liberal aspirations, and he
disappointed some in the loyalty to the throne,
the Church, the autocracy, and the established
order of things which he manifested later;
in turning to religion; in remaining in the
Government service; in writing patriotic
poems; in holding the position of Gentleman
of the Bed Chamber at Court; in being, in
fact, what is called a reactionary. But it
would be a mistake to imagine that Pushkin
was a Lost Leader who abandoned the cause
of liberty for a handful of silver and a riband
to stick in his coat. The liberal aspirations
of Pushkin&rsquo;s youth were the very air that the
whole of the aristocratic youth of that day
breathed. Pushkin could not escape being
influenced by it; but he was no more a rebel
then, than he was a reactionary afterwards,
when again the very air which the whole of
educated society breathed was conservative
and nationalistic. It may be a pity that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>92]</a></span>
was so; but so it was. There was no liberal
atmosphere in the reign of Nicholas I, and
the radical effervescence of the Decembrists
was destroyed by the Decembrists&rsquo; premature
action. It is no good making a revolution
if you have nothing to make it with. The
Decembrists were in the same position as
the educated &eacute;lite of one regiment at Versailles
would have been, had it attempted to destroy
the French monarchy in the days of Louis
XIV. The Decembrists by their premature
action put the clock of Russian political progress
back for years. The result was that
men of impulse, aspiration, talent and originality
had in the reign of Nicholas to seek
an outlet for their feelings elsewhere than in
politics, because politics then were simply
non-existent.</p>

<p>But apart from this, even if the opportunities
had been there, it may be doubted
whether Pushkin would have taken them.
He was not born with a passion to reform the
world. He was neither a rebel nor a reformer;
neither a liberal nor a conservative;
he was a democrat in his love for the whole of
the Russian people; he was a patriot in his
love of his country. He resembled Goethe
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>93]</a></span>
rather than Socrates, or Shelley, or Byron;
although, in his love of his country and in
every other respect, his fiery temperament
both in itself and in its expression was far
removed from Goethe&rsquo;s Olympian calm. He
was like Goethe in his attitude towards society,
and the attitude of the social and official
world towards him resembles the attitude of
Weimar towards Goethe.</p>

<p>During the first part of his career he gave
himself up to pleasure, passion, and self-indulgence;
after he was thirty he turned his
mind to more serious things. It would not
be exact to say he <em>became</em> deeply religious,
because he was religious by nature, and he
soon discarded a fleeting phase of scepticism;
but in spite of this he was a victim of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i>;
and he wavered between contempt
of the society around him and a petty resentment
against it which took the shape of
scathing and sometimes cruel epigrams. It
was this dangerous <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i>, the fact of
his being not only passion&rsquo;s slave, but petty
passion&rsquo;s slave, which made him a victim of
frivolous gossip and led to the final catastrophe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In Pushkin,&rdquo; says Soloviev, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>94]</a></span>
philosopher, &ldquo;according to his own testimony
there were two different and separate beings:
the inspired priest of Apollo, and the most
frivolous of all the frivolous children of the
world.&rdquo; It was the first Pushkin&mdash;the inspired
priest&mdash;who predominated in the latter
part of his life; but who was unable to expel
altogether the second Pushkin, the frivolous
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weltkind</i>, who was prone to be exasperated
by the society in which he lived, and when
exasperated was dangerous. There is one
fact, however, which accounts for much.
The more serious Pushkin&rsquo;s turn of thought
grew, the more objective, purer, and stronger
his work became, the less it was appreciated;
for the public which delighted in the comparatively
inferior work of his youth was not
yet ready for his more mature work. What
pleased the public were the dazzling colours,
the sensuous and sometimes libidinous images
of his early poems; the romantic atmosphere;
especially anything that was artificial in
them. They had not yet eyes to appreciate
the noble lines, nor ears to appreciate the
simpler and more majestic harmonies of his
later work. Thus it was that they passed <i>Boris
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>95]</a></span>
Godunov</i> by, and were disappointed in the
later cantos of <i>Onegin</i>. This was, of course,
discouraging. Nevertheless, it is laughable
to rank Pushkin amongst the misunderstood,
among the Shelleys, the Millets, of Literature
and Art; or to talk of his sad fate. To talk
of him as one of the victims of literature is
merely to depreciate him.</p>

<p>He was exiled. Yes: but to the Caucasus,
which gave him inspiration: to his own
country home, which gave him leisure. He
was censored. Yes: but the Emperor undertook
to do the work himself. Had he lived
in England, society&mdash;as was proved in the
case of Byron&mdash;would have been a far severer
censor of his morals and the extravagance of
his youth, than the Russian Government.
Besides which, he won instantaneous fame,
and in the society in which he moved he was
surrounded by a band not only of devoted but
distinguished admirers, amongst whom were
some of the highest names in Russian literature&mdash;Karamzin,
Zhukovsky, Gogol.</p>

<p>Pushkin is Russia&rsquo;s national poet, the Peter
the Great of poetry, who out of foreign
material created something new, national
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>96]</a></span>
and Russian, and left imperishable models for
future generations. The chief characteristic
of his genius is its universality. There
appeared to be nothing he could not understand
nor assimilate. And it is just this all-embracing
humanity&mdash;Dostoyevsky calls him
<ins class="greek" title="pananthr&ocirc;pos">&#960;&#945;&#957;&#8049;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</ins>     &mdash;this capacity for understanding
everything and everybody, which makes him
so profoundly Russian. He is a poet of everyday
life: a realistic poet, and above all things
a lyrical poet. He is not a dramatist, and as
an epic writer, though he can mould a bas-relief
and produce a noble fragment, he cannot set
crowds in motion. He revealed to the Russians
the beauty of their landscape and the poetry
of their people; and they, with ears full of
pompous diction, and eyes full of rococo and
romantic stage properties, did not understand
what he was doing: but they understood
later. For a time he fought against the
stream, and all in vain; and then he gave
himself up to the great current, which took
him all too soon to the open sea.</p>

<p>He set free the Russian language from the
bondage of the conventional; and all his life
he was still learning to become more and more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
intimate with the savour and smell of the
people&rsquo;s language. Like Peter the Great,
he spent his whole life in apprenticeship, and
his whole energies in craftsmanship. He was
a great artist; his style is perspicuous, plastic,
and pure; there is never a blurred outline,
never a smear, never a halting phrase or a
hesitating note. His concrete images are, as
it were, transparent, like Donne&rsquo;s description
of the woman whose</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&ldquo;... pure and eloquent blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spoke in her face, and so distinctly wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That you might almost think her body thought.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>His diction is the inseparable skin of the
thought. You seem to hear him thinking.
He was gifted with divine ease and unpremeditated
spontaneity. His soul was sincere,
noble, and open; he was frivolous, a child
of the world and of his century; but if he
was worldly, he was human; he was a citizen
as well as a child of the world; and it is that
which makes him the greatest of Russian
poets.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>98]</a></span>
His career was unromantic; he was rooted
to the earth; an aristocrat by birth, an official
by profession, a lover of society by taste. At
the same time, he sought and served beauty,
strenuously and faithfully; he was perhaps
too faithful a servant of Apollo; too exclusive
a lover of the beautiful. In his work you find
none of the piteous cries, no beauty of soaring
and bleeding wings as in Shelley, nor the
sound of rebellious sobs as in Musset; no
tempest of defiant challenge, no lightnings
of divine derision, as in Byron; his is neither
the martyrdom of a fighting Heine, that
&ldquo;brave soldier in the war of the liberation
of humanity,&rdquo; nor the agonized passion of a
suffering Catullus. He never descended into
Hell. Every great man is either an artist or
a fighter; and often poets of genius, Byron
and Heine for instance, are more pre-eminently
fighters than they are artists. Pushkin was
an artist, and not a fighter. And this is what
makes even his love-poems cold in comparison
with those of other poets. Although he was
the first to make notable what was called the
romantic movement; and although at the
beginning of his career he handled romantic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>99]</a></span>
subjects in a more or less romantic way, he
was fundamentally a classicist&mdash;a classicist
as much in the common-sense and realism and
solidity of his conceptions and ideas, as in the
perspicuity and finish of his impeccable form.
And he soon cast aside even the vehicles
and clothes of romanticism, and exclusively
followed reality. &ldquo;He strove with none, for
none was worth his strife.&rdquo; And when his
artistic ideals were misunderstood and depreciated,
he retired into himself and wrote
to please himself only; but in the inner court
of the Temple of Beauty into which he retired
he created imperishable things; for he loved
nature, he loved art, he loved his country,
and he expressed that love in matchless
song.</p>

<p>For years, Russian criticism was either
neglectful of his work or unjust towards it;
for his serene music and harmonious design
left the generations which came after him, who
were tossed on a tempest of social problems and
political aspirations, cold; but in 1881, when
Dostoyevsky unveiled Pushkin&rsquo;s memorial at
Moscow, the homage which he paid to the
dead poet voiced the unanimous feeling of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>100]</a></span>
the whole of Russia. His work is beyond
the reach of critics, whether favourable or
unfavourable, for it lives in the hearts of
his countrymen, and chiefly upon the lips of
the young.</p>

The poem was originally called <i>Mazepa</i>: Pushkin
changed the title so as not to clash with Byron. It is
interesting to see what Pushkin says of Byron&rsquo;s poem.
In his notes there is the following passage&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Byron knew Mazepa through Voltaire&rsquo;s history of
Charles XII. He was struck solely by the picture of a
man bound to a wild horse and borne over the steppes.
A poetical picture of course; but see what he did with it.
What a living creation! What a broad brush! But do
not expect to find either Mazepa or Charles, nor the usual
gloomy Byronic hero. Byron was not thinking of him.
He presented a series of pictures, one more striking than
the other. Had his pen come across the story of the
seduced daughter and the father&rsquo;s execution, it is improbable
that anyone else would have dared to touch
the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<br />
<small>LERMONTOV</small></h2>


<p>The romantic movement in Russia was, as
far as Pushkin was concerned, not really a
romantic movement at all. Still less was it
so in the case of the Pl&eacute;iade which followed
him. And yet, for want of a better word, one
is obliged to call it the <em>romantic</em> movement, as
it was a new movement, a renascence that
arose out of the ashes of the pseudo-classical
eighteenth century convention. Pushkin was
followed by a Pl&eacute;iade.</p>

<p>The claim of his friend and fellow-student,
<span class="smcap">Baron Delvig</span>, to fame, rests rather on his
friendship with Pushkin (to whom he played
the part of an admirable critic) than on his
own verse. He died in 1831. <span class="smcap">Yazykov</span>,
<span class="smcap">Prince Bariatinsky</span>, <span class="smcap">Venevitinov</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Polezhaev</span>, can all be included in the Pl&eacute;iade;
all these are lyrical poets of the second order,
and none of them&mdash;except Polezhaev, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>102]</a></span>
real promise of talent was shattered by circumstances
(he died of drink and consumption
after a career of tragic vicissitudes)&mdash;has
more than an historical interest.</p>

<p>Pushkin&rsquo;s successor to the throne of Russian
letters was Lermontov: no unworthy heir.
The name Lermontov is said to be the same
as the Scotch Learmonth. The story of his
short life is a simple one. He was born at
Moscow in 1814. He visited the Caucasus
when he was twelve. He was taught English
by a tutor. He went to school at Moscow,
and afterwards to the University. He left
in 1832 owing to the disputes he had with the
professors. At the age of eighteen, he entered
the Guards&rsquo; Cadet School at St. Petersburg;
and two years later he became an officer in
the regiment of the Hussars. In 1837 he was
transferred to Georgia, owing to the scandal
caused by the outspoken violence of his verse;
but he was transferred to Novgorod in 1838,
and was allowed to return to St. Petersburg
in the same year. In 1840 he was again
transferred to the Caucasus for fighting a duel
with the son of the French Ambassador;
towards the end of the year, he was once more
allowed to return to St. Petersburg. In 1841
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>103]</a></span>
he went back for a third time to the Caucasus,
where he forced a duel on one of his friends
over a perfectly trivial incident, and was killed,
on the 15th of July of the same year.</p>

<p>In all the annals of poetry, there is no more
curious figure than Lermontov. He was like
a plant that above all others needed a sympathetic
soil, a favourable atmosphere, and
careful attention. As it was, he came in the
full tide of the r&eacute;gime of Nicholas I, a r&eacute;gime
of patriarchal supervision, government interference,
rigorous censorship, and iron discipline,&mdash;a
grey epoch absolutely devoid of all
ideal aspirations. Considerable light is thrown
on the contradictory and original character of
the poet by his novel, <i>A Hero of Our Days</i>, the
first psychological novel that appeared in
Russia. The hero, Pechorin, is undoubtedly
a portrait of the poet, although he himself
said, and perhaps thought, that he was merely
creating a type.</p>

<p>The hero of the story, who is an officer in
the Caucasus, analyses his own character,
and lays bare his weaknesses, follies, and
faults, with the utmost frankness. &ldquo;I am
incapable of friendship,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Of two
friends, one is always the slave of the other,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>104]</a></span>
although often neither of them will admit it;
I cannot be a slave, and to be a master is a
tiring business.&rdquo; Or he writes: &ldquo;I have an
innate passion for contradiction.... The
presence of enthusiasm turns me to ice, and
intercourse with a phlegmatic temperament
would turn me into a passionate dreamer.&rdquo;
Speaking of enemies, he says: &ldquo;I love
enemies, but not after the Christian fashion.&rdquo;
And on another occasion: &ldquo;Why do they
all hate me? Why? Have I offended any
one? No. Do I belong to that category of
people whose mere presence creates antipathy?&rdquo;
Again: &ldquo;I despise myself sometimes,
is not that the reason that I despise
others? I have become incapable of noble
impulses. I am afraid of appearing ridiculous
to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the eve of fighting a duel Pechorin writes
as follows&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I die it will not be a great loss to the
world, and as for me, I am sufficiently tired
of life. I am like a man yawning at a ball,
who does not go home to bed because the
carriage is not there, but as soon as the carriage
is there, Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I review my past and I ask myself, Why
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>105]</a></span>
have I lived? Why was I born? and I think
there was a reason, and I think I was called
to high things, for I feel in my soul the presence
of vast powers; but I did not divine my high
calling; I gave myself up to the allurement
of shallow and ignoble passions; I emerged
from their furnace as hard and as cold as iron,
but I had lost for ever the ardour of noble
aspirations, the flower of life. And since then
how often have I played the part of the axe
in the hands of fate. Like the weapon of the
executioner I have fallen on the necks of the
victims, often without malice, always without
pity. My love has never brought happiness,
because I have never in the slightest degree
sacrificed myself for those whom I loved. I
loved for my own sake, for my own pleasure....
And if I die I shall not leave behind me one
soul who understood me. Some think I am
better, others that I am worse than I am.
Some will say he was a good fellow; others he
was a blackguard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It will be seen from these passages, all of
which apply to Lermontov himself, even if
they were not so intended, that he must have
been a trying companion, friend, or acquaintance.
He had, indeed, except for a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>106]</a></span>
intimate friends, an impossible temperament;
he was proud, overbearing, exasperated and exasperating,
filled with a savage <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour-propre</i>;
and he took a childish delight in annoying;
he cultivated &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le plaisir aristocratique de
d&eacute;plaire</span>&rdquo;; he was envious of what was least
enviable in his contemporaries. He could
not bear not to make himself felt, and if he
felt that he was unsuccessful in accomplishing
this by pleasant means, he resorted to unpleasant
means. And yet, at the same time,
he was warm-hearted, thirsting for love and
kindness, and capable of giving himself up
to love&mdash;if he chose.</p>

<p>During his period of training at the Cadet
School, he led a wild life; and when he
became an officer, he hankered after social
and not after literary success. He did not
achieve it immediately; at first he was not
noticed, and when he was noticed he was not
liked. His looks were unprepossessing, and
one of his legs was shorter than the other. His
physical strength was enormous&mdash;he could
bend a ramrod with his fingers. Noticed he
was determined to be; and, as he himself
says in one of his letters, observing that
every one in society had some sort of pedestal&mdash;wealth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
lineage, position, or patronage&mdash;he
saw that if he, not pre-eminently possessing
any of these,&mdash;though he was, as a matter of
fact, of a good Moscow family,&mdash;could succeed
in engaging the attention of one person,
others would soon follow suit. This he set
about to do by compromising a girl and
then abandoning her: and he acquired the
reputation of a Don Juan. Later, when
he came back from the Caucasus, he was
treated as a lion. All this does not throw a
pleasant light on his character, more especially
as he criticized in scathing tones the society
in which he was anxious to play a part, and
in which he subsequently enjoyed playing
a part. But perhaps both attitudes of mind
were sincere. He probably sincerely enjoyed
society, and hankered after success in it; and
equally sincerely despised society and himself
for hankering after it.</p>

<p>As he grew older, his pride and the exasperating
provocativeness of his conduct
increased to such an extent that he seemed
positively seeking for serious trouble, and for
some one whose patience he could overtax, and
on whom he could fasten a quarrel. And
this was not slow to happen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>108]</a></span>
At the bottom of all this lay no doubt a
deep-seated disgust with himself and with the
world in general, and a complete indifference
to life, resulting from large aspirations which
could not find an outlet, and so recoiled upon
himself. The epoch, the atmosphere and the
society were the worst possible for his peculiar
nature; and the only fruitful result of the
friction between himself and the society and
the established order of his time, was that he
was sent to the Caucasus, which proved to be
a source of inspiration for him, as it had
been for Pushkin. One is inclined to say,
&ldquo;If only he had lived later or longer&rdquo;; yet
it may be doubted whether, had he been born
in a more favourable epoch, either earlier in
the milder r&eacute;gime of Alexander I, or later,
in the enthusiastic epoch of the reforms, he
would have been a happier man and produced
finer work.</p>

<p>The curious thing is that his work does not
reveal an overwhelming pessimism like Leopardi&rsquo;s,
an accent of revolt like Musset&rsquo;s, or of
combat like Byron&rsquo;s; but rather it testifies to
a fundamental indifference to life, a concentrated
pride. If it be true that you can
roughly divide the Russian temperament into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>109]</a></span>
two types&mdash;the type of the pure fool, such as
Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <i>Idiot</i>, and a type of unconquerable
pride, such as Lucifer&mdash;then Lermontov
is certainly a fine example of the
second type. You feel that he will never
submit or yield; but then he died young; and
the Russian poets often changed, and not
infrequently adopted a compromise which was
the same thing as submission.</p>

<p>Lermontov was, like Pushkin, essentially
a lyric poet, still more subjective, and profoundly
self-centred. His attempts at the
drama (imitations of Schiller and an attempt
at the manner of Griboyedov) were failures.
But, unlike Pushkin, he was a true romantic;
and his work proves to us how essentially
different a thing Russian romanticism is from
French, German or English romanticism.
He began with astonishing precocity to write
verse when he was twelve. His earliest
efforts were in French. He then began to
imitate Pushkin. While at the Cadet School
he wrote a series of cleverly written, more or
less indecent, and more or less Byronic&mdash;the
Byron of <i>Beppo</i>&mdash;tales in verse, describing
his love adventures, and episodes of garrison
life. What brought him fame was his &ldquo;Ode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>110]</a></span>
on the Death of Pushkin,&rdquo; which, although
unjustified by the actual facts&mdash;he represents
Pushkin as the victim of a bloodthirsty
society&mdash;strikes strong and bitter chords.
Here, without any doubt, are &ldquo;thoughts
that breathe and words that burn&rdquo;&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

He struck this strong chord more than once,
especially in his indictment of his own generation,
called &ldquo;A Thought&rdquo;; and in a poem
written on the transfer of Napoleon&rsquo;s ashes
to Paris, in which he pours scorn on the
French for deserting Napoleon when he lived
and then acclaiming his ashes.</p>

<p>But it is not in poems such as these that
Lermontov&rsquo;s most characteristic qualities are
to be found. Lermontov owed nothing to
his contemporaries, little to his predecessors,
and still less to foreign models. It is true
that, as a school-boy, he wrote verses full of
Byronic disillusion and satiety, but these
were merely echoes of his reading. The
gloom of spirit which he expressed later on
was a permanent and innate feature of his
own temperament. Later, the reading of
Shelley spurred on his imagination to emulation,
but not to imitation. He sought his
own path from the beginning, and he remained
in it with obdurate persistence. He remained
obstinately himself, indifferent as a rule to
outside events, currents of thought and
feeling. And he clung to the themes which
he chose in his youth. His mind to him a
kingdom was, and he peopled it with images
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>112]</a></span>
and fancies of his own devising. The path
which he chose was a narrow one. It was a
romantic path. He chose for the subject of
the poem by which he is perhaps most widely
known, <i>The Demon</i>, the love of a demon for
a woman. The subject is as romantic as any
chosen by Thomas Moore; but there is nothing
now that appears rococo in Lermontov&rsquo;s work.
The colours are as fresh to-day as when they
were first laid on. The heroine is a Circassian
woman, and the action of the poem is in the
Caucasus.</p>

<p>The Demon portrayed is not the spirit that
denies of Goethe, nor Byron&rsquo;s Lucifer, looking
the Almighty in His face and telling him that
His evil is not good; nor does he cherish&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;the study of revenge, immortal hate,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>of Milton&rsquo;s Satan; but he is the lost angel of
a ruined paradise, who is too proud to accept
oblivion even were it offered to him. He
dreams of finding in Tamara the joys of the
paradise he has foregone. &ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; he
says to her, &ldquo;whom no one loves, whom
every human being curses.&rdquo; He declares
that he has foresworn his proud thoughts,
that he desires to be reconciled with Heaven,
to love, to pray, to believe in good. And he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>113]</a></span>
pours out to her one of the most passionate
love declarations ever written, in couplet after
couplet of words that glow like jewels and
tremble like the strings of a harp, Tamara
yields to him, and forfeits her life; but her
soul is borne to Heaven by the Angel of
Light; she has redeemed her sin by death,
and the Demon is left as before alone in a
loveless, lampless universe. The poem is
interspersed with descriptions of the Caucasus,
which are as glowing and splendid as the
impassioned utterance of the Demon. They
put Pushkin&rsquo;s descriptions in the shade.
Lermontov&rsquo;s landscape-painting compared
with Pushkin&rsquo;s is like a picture of Turner
compared with a Constable or a Bonnington.</p>

<p>Lermontov followed up his first draft of
<i>The Demon</i> (originally planned in 1829, but
not finished in its final form until 1841) with
other romantic tales, the scene of which for
the most part is laid in the Caucasus: such as
<i>Izmail Bey</i>, <i>Hadji-Abrek</i>, <i>Orsha the Boyar</i>&mdash;the
last not a Caucasian tale. These were nearly all
of them sketches in which he tried the colours
of his palette. But with <i>Mtsyri</i>, <i>the Novice</i>,
in which he used some of the materials of the
former tales, he produced a finished picture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>114]</a></span>
<i>Mtsyri</i> is the story of a Circassian orphan
who is educated in a convent. The child grows
up home-sick at heart, and one day his longing
for freedom becomes ungovernable, and he
escapes and roams about in the mountains.
He loses his way in the forest and is brought
back to the monastery after three days, dying
from starvation, exertion, and exhaustion.
Before he dies he pours out his confession,
which takes up the greater part of the poem.
He confesses how in the monastery he felt
his own country and his own people forever
calling, and how he felt he must seek his own
people. He describes his wanderings: how
he scrambles down the mountain-side and
hears the song of a Georgian woman, and
sees her as she walks down a narrow path with a
pitcher on her head and draws water from the
stream. At nightfall he sees the light of a
dwelling-place twinkling like a falling star;
but he dares not seek it. He loses his way
in the forest, he encounters and kills a
panther. In the morning, he finds a way out
of the woods when the daylight comes; he
lies in the grass exhausted under the blinding
noon, of which Lermontov gives a gorgeous
and detailed description&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>115]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;And on God&rsquo;s world there lay the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavy spell of utter sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although the landrail called, and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could hear the trill of the dragonfly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or else the lisping of the stream ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only a snake, with a yellow gleam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like golden lettering inlaid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hilt to tip upon a blade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was rustling, for the grass was dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the loose sand cautiously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It slid, and then began to spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roll itself into a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as though struck by sudden fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made haste to dart and disappear.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Perishing of hunger and thirst, fever and
delirium overtake him, and he fancies that
he is lying at the bottom of a deep stream,
where speckled fishes are playing in the
crystal waters. One of them nestles close to
him and sings to him with a silver voice a
lullaby, unearthly, like the song of Ariel, and
alluring like the call of the Erl King&rsquo;s
daughter. In this poem Lermontov reaches
the high-water mark of his descriptive powers.
Its pages glow with the splendour of the
Caucasus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>116]</a></span>
To his two masterpieces, <i>The Demon</i>
and <i>Mtsyri</i>, he was to add a third: <i>The
Song of the Tsar Ivan Vasilievich, the Oprichnik
(bodyguardsman), and the Merchant
Kalashnikov</i>. The Oprichnik insults the
Merchant&rsquo;s wife, and the Merchant challenges
him to fight with his fists, kills him, and
is executed for it. This poem is written as a
folk-story, in the style of the <i>Byliny</i>, and it
in no way resembles a <i>pastiche</i>. It equals, if
it does not surpass, Pushkin&rsquo;s <i>Boris Godunov</i>
as a realistic vision of the past; and as an
epic tale, for simplicity, absolute appropriateness
of tone, vividness, truth to nature and
terseness, there is nothing in modern Russian
literature to compare with it. Besides these
larger poems, Lermontov wrote a quantity
of short lyrics, many of which, such as &ldquo;The
Sail,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Angel,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Prayer,&rdquo; every
Russian child knows by heart.</p>

<p>When we come to consider the qualities of
Lermontov&rsquo;s romantic work, and ask ourselves
in what it differs from the romanticism of the
West&mdash;from that of Victor Hugo, Heine,
Musset, Espronceda&mdash;we find that in Lermontov&rsquo;s
work, as in all Russian work, there
is mingled with his lyrical, imaginative, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
descriptive powers, a bed-rock of matter-of-fact
common-sense, a root that is deeply
embedded in reality, in the life of everyday.
He never escapes into the &ldquo;intense inane&rdquo;
of Shelley. Imaginative he is, but he is never
lost in the dim twilight of Coleridge. Romantic
he is, but one note of Heine takes us into
a different world: for instance, Heine&rsquo;s quite
ordinary adventures in the Harz Mountains
convey a spell and glamour that takes us
over a borderland that Lermontov never
crossed.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more splendid than
Lermontov&rsquo;s descriptions; but they are, compared
with those of Western poets, concrete,
as sharp as views in a camera obscura. He
never ate the roots of &ldquo;relish sweet, the
honey wild and manna dew&rdquo; of the &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Belle
Dame Sans Merci</span>&rdquo;; he wrote of places where
Kubla Khan might have wandered, of &ldquo;ancestral
voices prophesying war,&rdquo; but one has
only to quote that line to see that Lermontov&rsquo;s
poetic world, compared with Coleridge&rsquo;s, is
solid fact beside intangible dream.</p>

<p>Compared even with Musset and Victor
Hugo, how much nearer the earth Lermontov
is than either of them! Victor Hugo dealt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>118]</a></span>
with just the same themes; but in Lermontov,
the most splendid painter of mountains
imaginable, you never hear</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Le vent qui vient &agrave; travers la montagne,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and you know that it will never drive the
Russian poet to frenzy. On the other hand,
you never get Victor Hugo&rsquo;s extravagance
and absurdities. Or take Musset; Musset
dealt with romantic themes <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">si quis alius</i>; but
when he deals with a subject like Don Juan,
which of all subjects belonged to the age of
Pushkin and Lermontov, he writes lines like
these&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Faible, et, comme le lierre, ayant besoin d&rsquo;autrui;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Et ne le cachant pas, et suspendant son &acirc;me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comme un luth &eacute;olien, aux l&egrave;vres de la nuit.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Here again we are confronted with a different
kind of imagination. Or take a bit of sheer
description&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;P&acirc;le comme l&rsquo;amour, et de pleurs arros&eacute;e,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La nuit aux pieds d&rsquo;argent descend dans la ros&eacute;e.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>You never find the Russian poet impersonating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>119]</a></span>
nature like this, and creating from objects
such as the &ldquo;yellow bees in the ivy bloom&rdquo;
forms more real than living man. The objects
themselves suffice. Lermontov sang of disappointed
love over and over again, but never
did he create a single image such as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Elle aurait aim&eacute;, si l&rsquo;orgueil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pareil &agrave; la lampe inutile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Qu&rsquo;on allume pr&egrave;s d&rsquo;un cercueil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">N&rsquo;eut veill&eacute; sur son coeur st&eacute;rile.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>In his descriptive work he is more like Byron;
but Byron was far less romantic and far less
imaginative than Lermontov, although he
invented Byronism, and shattered the crumbling
walls of the eighteenth century that
surrounded the city of romance, and dallied
with romantic themes in his youth. All his
best work, the finest passages of <i>Childe
Harold</i>, and the whole of <i>Don Juan</i>, were
slices of his own life and observation, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">choses
vues</i>; he never created a single character that
was not a reflection of himself; and he never
entered into the city whose walls he had
stormed, and where he had planted his flag.</p>

<p>This does not mean that Lermontov is
inferior to the Western romantic poets. It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>120]</a></span>
simply means that the Russian poet is&mdash;and
one might add the Russian poets are&mdash;different.
And, indeed, it is this very difference,&mdash;what
he did with this peculiar realistic paste in his
composition,&mdash;that constitutes his unique excellence.
So far from its being a vice, he made it
into his especial virtue. Lermontov sometimes,
in presenting a situation and writing a poem
on a fact, presents that situation and that
fact without exaggeration, emphasis, adornment,
imagery, metaphor, or fancy of any
kind, in the language of everyday life, and at
the same time he achieves poetry. This was
Wordsworth&rsquo;s ideal, and he fulfilled it.</p>

<p>A case in point is his long poem on the
Oprichnik, which has been mentioned; and
some of the most striking examples of this
unadorned and realistic writing are to be
found in his lyrics. In the &ldquo;Testament,&rdquo; for
example, where a wounded officer gives his
last instructions to his friend who is going
home on leave&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;I want to be alone with you,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A moment quite alone.<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>The language is the language of ordinary
everyday conversation. Every word the officer
says might have been said by him in ordinary
life, and there is not a note that jars; the speech
is the living speech of conversation without
being slang: and the result is a poignant
piece of poetry. Another perhaps still more
beautiful and touching example is the cradle-song
which a mother sings to a Cossack baby,
in which again every word has the native
savour and homeliness of a Cossack woman&rsquo;s
speech, and every feeling expressed is one
that she would have felt. A third example is
&ldquo;Borodino,&rdquo; an account of the famous battle
told by a veteran, as a veteran would tell it.
Lermontov&rsquo;s fishes never talk like big whales.</p>

<p>All Russian poets have this gift of reality
of conception and simplicity of treatment in
a greater or a lesser degree; perhaps none has
it in such a supreme degree as Lermontov.
The difference between Pushkin&rsquo;s style and
Lermontov&rsquo;s is that, when you read Pushkin,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>123]</a></span>
you think: &ldquo;How perfectly and how simply
that is said! How in the world did he
do it?&rdquo; You admire the &ldquo;magic hand of
chance.&rdquo; In reading Lermontov at his
simplest and best, you do not think about
the style at all, you simply respond to what
is said, and the style escapes notice in
its absolute appropriateness. Thus, what
Matthew Arnold said about Byron and Wordsworth
is true about Lermontov&mdash;there are
moments when Nature takes the pen from
his hand and writes for him.</p>

<p>In Lermontov there is nothing slovenly;
but there is a great deal that is flat and
sullen. But if one reviews the great amount
of work he produced in his short life, one is
struck, not by its variety, as in the case of
Pushkin,&mdash;it is, on the contrary, limited and
monotonous in subject,&mdash;but by his authentic
lyrical inspiration, by the strength, the intensity,
the concentration of his genius, the
richness of his imagination, the wealth of
his palette, his gorgeous colouring and the
high level of his strong square musical verse.
And perhaps more than by anything else,
one is struck by the blend in his nature
and his work which has just been discussed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
of romantic imagination and stern reality, of
soaring thought and earthly common-sense, as
though we had before us the temperament of
a Thackeray with the wings of a Shelley.
Lermontov is certainly, whichever way you
take him, one of the most astonishing figures,
and certainly the greatest purely lyrical
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erscheinung</i> in Russian literature.</p>

<p>With the death of Lermontov in 1841, the
springtide of national song that began in the
reign of Alexander I comes to an end; for
the only poet he left behind him did not
survive him long. This was his contemporary
<span class="smcap">Koltsov</span> (1809-42), the greatest of Russian
folk-poets. The son of a cattle-dealer, after
a fitful and short-lived primary education at
the district school of Voronezh, he adopted
his father&rsquo;s trade, and by a sheer accident a
cultivated young man of Moscow came across
him and his verses, and raised funds for their
publication.</p>

<p>Koltsov&rsquo;s verse paints peasant life as it is,
without any sentimentality or rhetoric; it is
described from the inside, and not from the
outside. This is the great difference between
Koltsov and other popular poets who came
later. Moreover, he caught and reproduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>125]</a></span>
the true <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkston</i> in his lyrics, so that they are
indistinguishable in accent from real folk-poetry.
Koltsov sings of the woods, and the
rustling rye, of harvest time and sowing; the
song of the love-sick girl reaping; the lonely
grave; the vague dreams and desires of the
peasant&rsquo;s heart. His pictures have the dignity
and truth of Jean Fran&ccedil;ois Millet, and his
&ldquo;lyrical cry&rdquo; is as authentic as that of Burns.
His more literary poems are like Burns&rsquo;
English poems compared with his work in the
Scots. But he died the year after Lermontov,
of consumption, and with his death the curtain
was rung down on the first act of Russian
literature. When it was next rung up, it was

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<br />
<small>THE AGE OF PROSE</small></h2>


<p>When the curtain again rose on Russian
literature it was on an era of prose; and
the leading protagonist of that era, both
by his works of fiction and his dramatic
work, was <span class="smcap">Nicholas Gogol</span> [1809-52]. It is
true that in the thirties Russia began to
produce home-made novels. In Pushkin&rsquo;s
story <i>The Queen of Spades</i>, when somebody
asks the old Countess if she wishes to read a
Russian novel, she says &ldquo;A Russian novel?
Are there any?&rdquo; This stage had been
passed; but the novels and the plays that
were produced at this time until the advent
of Gogol have been&mdash;deservedly for the
greater part&mdash;forgotten. And, just as Lermontov
was the successor of Pushkin in the
domain of poetry, so in the domain of satire
Gogol was the successor of Griboyedov; and
in creating a national work he was the heir
of Pushkin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>127]</a></span>
Gogol was a Little Russian. He was born
in 1809 near Poltava, in the Cossack country,
and was brought up by his grandfather, a
Cossack; but he left the Ukraine and settled
in 1829 in St. Petersburg, where he obtained
a place in a Government office. After an
unsuccessful attempt to go on the stage, and
a brief career as tutor, he was given a professorship
of History; but he failed here also,
and finally turned to literature. The publication
of his first efforts gained him the acquaintance
of the literary men of the day, and he
became the friend of Pushkin, who proved a
valuable friend, adviser, and critic, and urged
him to write on the life of the people. He
lived in St. Petersburg from 1829 to 1836;
and it was perhaps home-sickness which
inspired him to write his Little Russian
sketches&mdash;<i>Evenings on a Farm on the Dikanka</i>,&mdash;which
appeared in 1832, followed by <i>Mirgorod</i>,
a second series, in 1834.</p>

<p>Gogol&rsquo;s temperament was romantic. He
had a great deal of the dreamer in him, a
touch of the eerie, a delight in the supernatural,
an impish fancy that reminds one
sometimes of Hoffmann and sometimes of
R.&nbsp;L. Stevenson, as well as a deep religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>128]</a></span>
vein which was later on to dominate and oust
all his other qualities. But, just as we find
in the Russian poets a curious mixture of
romanticism and realism, of imagination and
common-sense, so in Gogol, side by side with
his imaginative gifts, which were great, there
is a realism based on minute observation.
In addition to this, and tempering his penetrating
observation, he had a rich streak
of humour, a many-sided humour, ranging
from laughter holding both its sides, to a
delicate and half melancholy chuckle, and in
his later work to biting irony.</p>

<p>In the very first story of his first book,
&ldquo;The Fair of Sorochinetz,&rdquo; we are plunged into
an atmosphere that smells of Russia in a way
that no other Russian book has ever yet
savoured of the soil. We are plunged into the
South, on a blazing noonday, when the corn is
standing in sheaves and wheat is being sold at
the fair; and the fair, with its noise, its smell
and its colour, rises before us as vividly as
Normandy leaps out of the pages of Maupassant,
or Scotland from the pages of Stevenson.
And just as Andrew Lang once said that
probably only a Scotsman, and a Lowland
Scotsman, could know how true to life the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>129]</a></span>
characters in <i>Kidnapped</i> were, so it is probable
that only a Russian, and indeed a Little Russian,
appreciates to the full how true to life are
the people, the talk, and the ambient air in the
tales of Gogol. And then we at once get that
hint of the supernatural which runs like a
scarlet thread through all these stories; the
rumour that the <i>Red Jacket</i> has been observed
in the fair; and the <i>Red Jacket</i>, so the gossips
say, belongs to a little Devil, who being turned
out of Hell as a punishment for some misdemeanour&mdash;probably
a good intention&mdash;established
himself in a neighbouring barn, and
from home-sickness took to drink, and drank
away all his substance; so that he was obliged
to pawn his red jacket for a year to a Jew,
who sold it before the year was out, whereupon
the buyer, recognizing its unholy origin,
cut it up into bits and threw it away,
after which the Devil appeared in the shape
of a pig every year at the fair to find the
pieces. It is on this Red Jacket that the
story turns.</p>

<p>In this first volume, the supernatural plays
a predominant part throughout; the stories
tell of water-nymphs, the Devil, who steals
the moon, witches, magicians, and men who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>130]</a></span>
traffic with the Evil One and lose their souls.
In the second series, <i>Mirgorod</i>, realism comes
to the fore in the stories of &ldquo;The Old-Fashioned
Landowners&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Quarrel
of the Two Ivans.&rdquo; These two stories contain
between them the sum and epitome of
the whole of one side of Gogol&rsquo;s genius, the
realistic side. In the one story, &ldquo;The Old-Fashioned
Landowners,&rdquo; we get the gentle
good humour which tells the charming tale
of a South Russian Philemon and Baucis,
their hospitality and kindliness, and the loneliness
of Philemon when Baucis is taken away,
told with the art of La Fontaine, and with
many touches that remind one of Dickens.
The other story, &ldquo;The Quarrel of the Two
Ivans,&rdquo; who are bosom friends and quarrel
over nothing, and are, after years, on the
verge of making it up when the mere mention
of the word &ldquo;goose&rdquo; which caused the quarrel
sets alight to it once more and irrevocably,
is in Gogol&rsquo;s richest farcical vein, with just a
touch of melancholy.</p>

<p>And in the same volume, two <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouvelles</i>,
<i>Tarass Bulba</i> and <i>Viy</i>, sum up between them
the whole of the other side of Gogol&rsquo;s genius.
<i>Tarass Bulba</i>, a short historical novel, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>131]</a></span>
its incomparably vivid picture of Cossack life,
is Gogol&rsquo;s masterpiece in the epic vein. It is
as strong and as direct as a Border ballad.
<i>Viy</i>, which tells of a witch, is the most
creepy and imaginative of his supernatural
stories.</p>

<p>Later, he published two more collections of
stories: <i>Arabesques</i> (1834) and <i>Tales</i> (1836).
In these, poetry, witches, water-nymphs,
magicians, devils, and epic adventure are all
left behind. The element of the fantastic
still subsists, as in the &ldquo;Portrait,&rdquo; and of the
grotesque, as in the story of the major who
loses his nose, which becomes a separate
personality, and wanders about the town.
But his blend of realism and humour comes
out strongly in the story of &ldquo;The Carriage,&rdquo;
and his blend of realism and pathos still
more strongly in the story of &ldquo;The Overcoat,&rdquo;
the story of a minor public servant
who is always shivering and whose dream
it is to have a warm overcoat. After years
of privation he saves enough money to
buy one, and on the first day he wears it, it
is stolen. He dies of melancholia, and his
ghost haunts the streets. This story is the
only begetter of the large army of pathetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>132]</a></span>
figures of failure that crowd the pages of
Russian literature.</p>

<p>While Gogol had been writing and publishing
these tales, he had also been steadily writing
for the stage; but here the great difficulty
and obstacle was the Censorship, which was
almost as severe as it was in England at the
end of the reign of Edward VII. But, by a
curious paradox, the play, which you would
have expected the Censorship to forbid before
all other plays, <i>The Revisor</i>, or <i>Inspector-General</i>,
was performed. This was owing to
the direct intervention of the Emperor. <i>The
Revisor</i> is the second comic masterpiece of the
Russian stage. The plot was suggested to
Gogol by Pushkin. The officials of an obscure
country town hear the startling news that a
Government Inspector is arriving incognito
to investigate their affairs. A traveller from
St. Petersburg&mdash;a fine natural liar&mdash;is taken
for the Inspector, plays up to the part,
and gets away just before the arrival of the
real Inspector, which is the end of the play.
The play is a satire on the Russian bureaucracy.
Almost every single character in it
is dishonest; and the empty-headed, and
irrelevant hero, with his magnificent talent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>133]</a></span>
for easy lying, is a masterly creation. The
play at once became a classic, and retains all
its vitality and comic force to-day. There is
no play which draws a larger audience on
holidays in St. Petersburg and Moscow.</p>

<p>After the production of <i>The Revisor</i>, Gogol
left Russia for ever and settled in Rome. He
had in his mind a work of great importance
on which he had already been working for
some time. This was his <i>Dead Souls</i>, his
most ambitious work, and his masterpiece. It
was Pushkin who gave him the idea of the
book. The hero of the book, Chichikov,
conceives a brilliant idea. Every landlord
possessed so many serfs, called &ldquo;souls.&rdquo;
A revision took place every ten years, and
the landlord had to pay for poll-tax on
the &ldquo;souls&rdquo; who had died during that period.
Nobody looked at the lists between the
periods of revision. Chichikov&rsquo;s idea was to
take over the dead souls from the landlord,
who would, of course, be delighted to be rid
of the fictitious property and the real tax,
to register his purchases, and then to mortgage
at a bank at St. Petersburg or Moscow, the
&ldquo;souls,&rdquo; which he represented as being in
some place in the Crimea, and thus make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>134]</a></span>
money enough to buy &ldquo;souls&rdquo; of his own.
The book tells of the adventures of Chichikov
as he travels over Russia in search of dead
&ldquo;souls,&rdquo; and is, like Mr. Pickwick&rsquo;s adventures,
an Odyssey, introducing us to every kind and
manner of man and woman. The book was
to be divided in three parts. The first
part appeared in 1842. Gogol went on
working at the second and third parts until
1852, when he died. He twice threw the
second part of the work into the fire when it
was finished; so that all we possess is the
first part, and the second part printed from an
incomplete manuscript. The second part was
certainly finished when he destroyed it, and
it is probable that the third part was sketched.
He had intended in the second part to work
out the moral regeneration of Chichikov, and
to give to the world his complete message.
Persecuted by a dream he was unable to realize
and an ambition which he was not able to
fulfil, Gogol was driven inwards, and his natural
religious feeling grew more intense and made
him into an ascetic and a recluse. This break
in the middle of his career is characteristic of
Russia. Tolstoy, of course, furnishes the most
typical example of the same thing. But it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
a common Russian characteristic for men
midway in a successful career to turn aside
from it altogether, and seek consolation in
the things which are not of this world.</p>

<p>Gogol&rsquo;s <i>Dead Souls</i> made a deep impression
upon educated Russia. It pleased the enthusiasts
for Western Europe by its reality,
its artistic conception and execution, and by its
social ideas; and it pleased the Slavophile
Conservatives by its truth to life, and by its
smell of Russia. When the first chapter was
read aloud to Pushkin, he said, when Gogol
had finished: &ldquo;God, what a sad country
Russia is!&rdquo; And it is certainly true, that
amusing as the book is, inexpressibly comic
as so many of the scenes are, Gogol does
not flatter his country or his countrymen;
and when Russians read it at the time it
appeared, many must have been tempted
to murmur &ldquo;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">doux pays!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;as they would,
indeed, now, were a writer with the genius
of a Gogol to appear and describe the adventures
of a modern Chichikov; for, though
circumstances may be entirely different, although
there are no more &ldquo;souls&rdquo; to be
bought or sold, Chichikov is still alive&mdash;and
as Gogol said, there was probably not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>136]</a></span>
one of his readers who after an honest self-examination,
would not wonder if he had
not something of Chichikov in him, and who
if he were to meet an acquaintance at that
moment, would not nudge his companion and
say: &ldquo;There goes Chichikov.&rdquo; &ldquo;And who
and what is Chichikov?&rdquo; The answer is: &ldquo;A
scoundrel.&rdquo; But such an entertaining scoundrel,
so abject, so shameless, so utterly devoid
of self-respect, such a magnificent liar, so
plausible an impostor, so ingenious a cheat,
that he rises from scoundrelism almost to
greatness.</p>

<p>There is, indeed, something of the greatness
of Falstaff in this trafficker of dead &ldquo;souls.&rdquo;
His baseness is almost sublime. He in any
case merits a place in the gallery of humanity&rsquo;s
typical and human rascals, where Falstaff,
Tartuffe, Pecksniff, and Count Fosco reign.
He has the great saving merit of being human;
nor can he be accused of hypocrisy. His
coachman, Selifan, who got drunk with every
&ldquo;decent man,&rdquo; is worthy of the creator of
Sam Weller. But what distinguishes Gogol
in his <i>Dead Souls</i> from the great satirists of
other nations, and his satire from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saeva
indignatio</i> of Swift, for instance, is that, after
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>137]</a></span>
laying bare to the bones the rascality of his
hero, he turns round on his audience and tells
them that there is no cause for indignation;
Chichikov is only a victim of a ruling passion&mdash;gain;
perhaps, indeed, in the chill existence
of a Chichikov, there may be something
which will one day cause us to humble ourselves
on our knees and in the dust before the
Divine Wisdom. His irony is lined with
indulgence; his sleepless observation is tempered
by fundamental charity. He sees what
is mean and common clearer than any one,
but he does not infer from it that life, or mankind,
or the world is common or mean. He
infers the opposite. He puts Chichikov no
lower morally than he would put Napoleon,
Harpagon, or Don Juan&mdash;all of them victims
of a ruling passion, and all of them great by
reason of it&mdash;for Chichikov is also great in
rascality, just as Harpagon was great in
avarice, and Don Juan great in profligacy.
And this large charity blent with biting irony
is again peculiarly Russian.</p>

<p><i>Dead Souls</i> is a deeper book than any of
Gogol&rsquo;s early work. It is deep in the same
way as <i>Don Quixote</i> is deep; and like <i>Don
Quixote</i> it makes boys laugh, young men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
think, and old men weep. Apart from its
philosophy and ideas, <i>Dead Souls</i> had a great
influence on Russian literature as a work of
art. Just as Pushkin set Russian poetry free
from the high-flown and the conventional, so
did Gogol set Russian fiction free from the
dominion of the grand style. He carried
Pushkin&rsquo;s work&mdash;the work which Pushkin
had accomplished in verse and adumbrated
in prose&mdash;much further; and by depicting
ordinary life, and by writing a novel without
any love interest, with a Chichikov for a
hero, he created Russian realism. He described
what he saw without flattery and
without exaggeration, but with the masterly
touch, the instinctive economy, the sense of
selection of a great artist.</p>

<p>This, at the time it was done, was a revolution.
Nobody then would have dreamed it
possible to write a play or a novel without
a love-motive; and just as Pushkin revealed
to Russia that there was such a thing as
Russian landscape, Gogol again, going one
better, revealed the fascination, the secret
and incomprehensible power that lay in the
flat monotony of the Russian country, and the
inexhaustible source of humour, absurdity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>139]</a></span>
irony, quaintness, farce, comedy in the
everyday life of the ordinary people. So
that, however much his contemporaries might
differ as to the merits or demerits, the harm
or the beneficence, of his work, he left his
nation with permanent and classic models of
prose and fiction and stories, just as Pushkin
had bequeathed to them permanent models
of verse.</p>

<p>Gogol wrote no more fiction after <i>Dead
Souls</i>. In 1847 <i>Passages from a Correspondence
with a Friend</i> was published, which
created a sensation, because in the book
Gogol preached submission to the Government,
both spiritual and temporal. The
Western enthusiasts and the Liberals in
general were highly disgusted. One can
understand their disgust; it is less easy to
understand their surprise; for Gogol had
never pretended to be a Liberal. He showed
up the evils of Bureaucracy and the follies and
weaknesses of Bureaucrats, because they were
there, just as he showed up the stinginess
of misers and the obstinacy of old women.
But it is quite as easy for a Conservative
to do this as it is for a Liberal, and quite as
easy for an orthodox believer as for an atheist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>140]</a></span>
But Gogol&rsquo;s contemporaries had not realized
the tempest that had been raging for a long
time in Gogol&rsquo;s soul, and which he kept to
himself. He had always been religious, and
now he became exclusively religious; he made
a pilgrimage to the Holy Land; he spent his
substance in charity, especially to poor
students; and he lived in asceticism until he
died, at the age of forty-three. What a waste,
one is tempted to say&mdash;and how often one is
tempted to say this in the annals of Russian
literature&mdash;and yet, one wonders!</p>

<p>What we possess of the second part of
<i>Dead Souls</i> is in Gogol&rsquo;s best vein, and of
course one cannot help bitterly regretting that
the rest was destroyed or possibly never
written; but one wonders whether, had he
not had within him the intensity of feeling
which led him ultimately to renounce art,
he would have been the artist that he was;
whether he would have been capable of creating
so many-coloured a world of characters,
and whether the soil out of which those works
grew was not in reality the kind of soil out
of which religious renunciation was at last
bound to flower. However that may be,
Gogol left behind him a rich inheritance. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>141]</a></span>
is one of the great humorists of European
literature, and whoever gives England a
really fine translation of his work, will do
his country a service. M&eacute;rim&eacute;e places Gogol
among the best <em>English</em> humorists. His
humour and his pathos were closely allied;
but there is no acidity in his irony. His work
may sometimes sadden you, but (as in the
case of Krylov&rsquo;s two pigeons) it will never
bore you, and it will never leave you with a
feeling of stale disgust or a taste as of sharp
alum, for his work is based on charity, and it
has in its form and accent the precious gift
of charm. Gogol is an author who will always
be loved even as much as he is admired, and
his stories are a boon to the young; to
many a Russian boy and girl the golden gates
of romance have been opened by Gogol, the
destroyer of Russian romanticism, the inaugurator
of Russian realism.</p>

<p>Side by side with fiction, another element
grew up in this age of prose, namely criticism.
Karamzin in the twenties had been the first
to introduce literary criticism, and critical
appreciations of Pushkin&rsquo;s work appeared
from time to time in the <i>European Messenger</i>.
<span class="smcap">Prince Vyazemsky</span>, whose literary activity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>142]</a></span>
lasted from 1808-78, was a critic as well
as a poet and a satirist, a fine example of the
type of great Russian nobles so frequent in
Russian books, who were not only saturated
with culture but enriched literature with
their work, and carried on the tradition of
cool, clear wit, clean expression, and winged
phrase that we find in Griboyedov. <span class="smcap">Polevoy</span>,
a self-educated man of humble extraction,
was the first professional journalist, and
created the tradition of violent and fiery
polemics, which has lasted till this day in
Russian journalism. But the real founder of
Russian &aelig;sthetic, literary, and journalistic
criticism was <span class="smcap">Belinsky</span> (1811-1847).</p>

<p>Like Polevoy, he was of humble extraction
and almost entirely self-educated. He lived
in want and poverty and ill-health. His life
was a long battle against every kind of
difficulty and obstacle; his literary production
was more than hampered by the Censorship,
but his influence was far-reaching and
deep. He created Russian criticism, and
after passing through several phases&mdash;a German
phase of Hegelian philosophy, Gallophobia,
enthusiasm for Shakespeare and
Goethe and for objective art, a French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>143]</a></span>
phase of enthusiasm for art as practised in
France, ended finally in a didactic phase of
which the watchword was that Life was more
important than Art.</p>

<p>The first blossoms of the new generation
of writers, Goncharov, Dostoyevsky, Herzen,
and others, grew up under his encouragement.
He expounded Pushkin, Lermontov, Gogol,
Griboyedov, Zhukovsky and the writers of the
past. His judgments have remained authoritative;
but some of his final judgments, which
were unshaken for generations, such as for
instance his estimates of Pushkin and Lermontov,
were much biassed and coloured by his
didacticism. He burnt what he had adored
in the case of Gogol, who, like Pushkin, became
for him too much of an artist, and not enough
of a social reformer. Whatever phase Belinsky
went through, he was passionate, impulsive,
and violent, incapable of being objective, or of
doing justice to an opponent, or of seeing two
sides to a question. He was a polemical and
fanatical knight errant, the prophet and
propagandist of Western influence, the bitter
enemy of the Slavophiles.</p>

<p>The didactic stamp which he gave to Russian
&aelig;sthetic and literary criticism has remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
on it ever since, and differentiates it from the
literary and &aelig;sthetic criticism of the rest of
Europe, not only from that school of criticism
which wrote and writes exclusively under the
banner of &ldquo;Art for Art&rsquo;s Sake,&rdquo; but from
those Western critics who championed the
importance of moral ideas in literature, just as
ardently as he did himself, and who deprecated
the theory of Art for Art&rsquo;s sake just as strongly.
Thus it is that, from the beginning of Russian
criticism down to the present day, a truly
objective criticism scarcely exists in Russian
literature. &AElig;sthetic criticism becomes a
political weapon. &ldquo;Are you in my camp?&rdquo;
if so, you are a good writer. &ldquo;Are you in
my opponent&rsquo;s camp?&rdquo; then your god-gifted
genius is mere dross.</p>

<p>The reason of this has been luminously stated
by Professor Br&uuml;ckner: &ldquo;To the intelligent
Russian, without a free press, without the
liberty of assembly, without the right to free
expression of opinion, literature became the
last refuge of freedom of thought, the only
means of propagating higher ideas. He expected
of his country&rsquo;s literature not merely
&aelig;sthetic recreation; he placed it at the service
of his aspirations.... Hence the striking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>145]</a></span>
partiality, nay unfairness, displayed by the
Russians towards the most perfect works of
their own literature, when they did not respond
to the aims or expectations of their
party or their day.&rdquo; And speaking of the
criticism that was produced after 1855, he
says: &ldquo;This criticism is often, in spite of all
its giftedness, its ardour and fire, only a
mockery of all criticism. The work only
serves as an example on which to hang the
critics&rsquo; own views.... This is no reproach; we
simply state the fact, and fully recognize the
necessity and usefulness of the method. With
a backward society, ... this criticism was a
means which was sanctified by the end, the
spreading of free opinions.... Unhappily,
Russian literary criticism has remained till
to-day almost solely journalistic, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i> didactic
and partisan. See how even now it treats
the most interesting, exceptional, and mighty
of all Russians, Dostoyevsky, merely because
he does not fit into the Radical mould! How
unjust it has been towards others! How it
has extolled to the clouds the representatives
of its own camp!&rdquo; I quote Professor Br&uuml;ckner,
lest I should be myself suspected of being
partial in this question. The question,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>146]</a></span>
perhaps, may admit of further expansion. It is
not that the Russian critics were merely convinced
it was all-important that art should
have ideas at the roots of it, and had no
patience with a merely shallow &aelig;stheticism.
They went further; the ideas had to be of
one kind. A definite political tendency had
to be discerned; and if the critic disagreed
with that political tendency, then no amount
of qualities&mdash;not artistic excellence, form,
skill, style, not even genius, inspiration, depth,
feeling, philosophy&mdash;were recognized.</p>

<p>Herein lies the great difference between
Russian and Western critics, between Sainte-Beuve
and Belinsky; between Matthew Arnold
and his Russian contemporaries. Matthew
Arnold defined the highest poetry as being a
criticism of life; but that would not have
prevented him from doing justice either to
a poet so polemical as Byron, or to a poet so
completely unpolitical, so sheerly &aelig;sthetic
as Keats; to Lord Beaconsfield as a novelist,
to Mr. Morley or Lord Acton as historians,
because their &ldquo;tendency&rdquo; or their &ldquo;politics&rdquo;
were different from his own. The most
biassed of English or French critics is broad-minded
compared to a Russian critic. Had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
Keats been a Russian poet, Belinsky would
have swept him away with contempt; Wordsworth
would have been condemned as reactionary;
and Swinburne&rsquo;s politics alone
would have been taken into consideration.
At the present day, almost ten years after Professor
Br&uuml;ckner wrote his <i>History of Russian
Literature</i>, now that the press is more or less
free, save for occasional pin-pricks, now that
literary output is in any case unfettered, and
the stage freer than it is in England, the same
criticism still applies. Russian literary criticism
is still journalistic. There are and there
always have been brilliant exceptions, of
course, two of the most notable of which are
<span class="smcap">Volynsky</span> and <span class="smcap">Merezhkovsky</span>; but as a rule
the political camp to which the writer belongs
is the all-important question; and I know
cases of Russian politicians who have been
known to refuse to write, even in foreign reviews,
because they disapproved of the &ldquo;tendency&rdquo;
of those reviews, the tendency being
non-existent&mdash;as is generally the case with
English reviews,&mdash;and the review harbouring
opinions of every shade and tendency. You
would think that narrow-mindedness could no
further go than to refuse to let your work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>148]</a></span>
appear in an impartial organ, lest in that same
organ an opinion opposed to your own might
appear also. But the cause of this is the same
now as it used to be, namely that, in spite of
there being a greater measure of freedom in
Russia, political liberty does not yet exist.
Liberty of assembly does not exist; liberty of
conscience only partially exists; the press is
annoyed and hampered by restrictions; and
the great majority of Russian writers are still
engaged in fighting for these things, and
therefore still ready to sacrifice fairness for
the greater end,&mdash;the achievement of political
freedom.</p>

<p>Thus criticism in Russia became a question
of camps, and the question arises, what were
these camps? From the dawn of the age of
pure literature, Russia was divided into two
great camps: The Slavophiles and the
Propagandists of Western Ideas.</p>

<p>The trend towards the West began with
the influence of Joseph Le Maistre and the
St. Petersburg Jesuits. In 1836, <span class="smcap">Chaadaev</span>,
an ex-guardsman who had served in the
Russian campaign in France and travelled a
great deal in Western Europe, and who shared
Joseph Le Maistre&rsquo;s theory that Russia had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>149]</a></span>
suffered by her isolation from the West and
through the influence of the former Byzantine
Empire, published the first of his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lettres sur
la Philosophie de l&rsquo;Histoire</i> in the <i>Telescope</i> of
Moscow. This letter came like a bomb-shell.
He glorified the tradition and continuity of the
Catholic world. He said that Russia existed,
as it were, outside of time, without the tradition
either of the Orient or of the Occident, and that
the universal culture of the human race had
not touched it. &ldquo;The atmosphere of the
West produces ideas of duty, law, justice,
order; we have given nothing to the world
and taken nothing from it; ... we have
not contributed anything to the progress of
humanity, and we have disfigured everything
we have taken from that progress. Hostile
circumstances have alienated us from the
general trend in which the social idea of
Christianity grew up; thus we ought to revise
our faith, and begin our education over again
on another basis.&rdquo; The expression of these
incontrovertible sentiments resulted in the
exile of the editor of the <i>Telescope</i>, the dismissal
of the Censor, and in the official
declaration of Chaadaev&rsquo;s insanity, who was
put under medical supervision for a year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>150]</a></span>
Chaadaev made disciples who went further
than he did, <span class="smcap">Princess Volkonsky</span>, the
authoress of a notable book on the Orthodox
Church, and <span class="smcap">Prince Gagarin</span>, who both became
Catholics. This was one branch of Westernism.
Another branch, to which Belinsky
belonged, had no Catholic leanings, but
sought for salvation in socialism and atheism.
The most important figure in this branch is
<span class="smcap">Alexander Herzen</span> (1812-1870). His real
name was Yakovlev; his father, a wealthy
nobleman, married in Germany, but did not
legalize his marriage in Russia, so his children
took their mother&rsquo;s name.</p>

<p>Herzen&rsquo;s career belongs rather to the history
of Russia than to the history of Russian literature;
were it not that, besides being one of the
greatest and most influential personalities of
his time, he was a great memoir-writer. He
began, after a mathematical training at the
University, with fiction, of which the best
example is a novel <i>Who is to Blame?</i> which
paints the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">g&eacute;nie sans portefeuille</i> of the
period that Turgenev was so fond of depicting.
Herzen was exiled on account of his oral propaganda,
first to Perm, and then to Vyatka.
In 1847, he left Russia for ever, and lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>151]</a></span>
abroad for the rest of his life, at first in Paris,
and afterwards in London, where he edited a
newspaper called <i>The Bell</i>.</p>

<p>Herzen was a Socialist. Western Europe
he considered to be played out. He looked
upon Socialism as a new religion and a new
form of Christianity, which would be to the
new world what Christianity had been to the
old. The Russian peasants would play the
part of the Invasion of the Barbarians; and
the functions of the State would be taken
over by the Russian Communes on a basis of
voluntary and mutual agreement&mdash;the principle
of the Commune, of sharing all possessions
in common, being so near the fundamental
principle of Christianity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thinking Russian,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;is the
most independent being in the world. What
can stop him? Consideration for the past?
But what is the starting-point of modern
Russian history if it be not a total negation
of nationalism and tradition?... What do
we care, disinherited minors that we are, for
the duties you have inherited? Can your
worn-out morality satisfy us? Your morality
which is neither Christian nor human, which
is used only in copybooks and for the ritual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
of the law?&rdquo; Again: &ldquo;We are free because
we begin with our own liberation; we are
independent; we have nothing to lose or to
honour. A Russian will never be a protestant,
or follow the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">juste milieu</i> ... our civilization
is external, our corrupt morals quite
crude.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The great point Herzen was always making
was that Russia had escaped the baleful tradition
of Western Europe, and the hereditary
infection of Western corruption. Thus, in his
disenchantment with Western society and
his enthusiasm for the communal ownership
of land, he was at one with the Slavophiles;
where he differed from them was in accepting
certain Western ideas, and in thinking that a
new order of things, a new heaven and
earth, could be created by a social revolution,
which should be carried out by the Slavs.
His influence&mdash;he was one of the precursors
of Nihilism, for the seed he sowed, falling on
the peculiar soil where it fell, produced the
whirlwind as a harvest&mdash;belongs to history.
What belongs to literature are his memoirs,
<i>My Past and my Thoughts</i> (<i>Byloe i Dumy</i>),
which were written between 1852 and 1855.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>153]</a></span>
These memoirs of everyday life and encounters
with all sorts and conditions of extraordinary
men are in their subject-matter as exciting
as a novel, and, in their style, on a level with
the masterpieces of Russian prose, through
their subtle psychology, interest, wit, and
artistic form.</p>

<p>Herzen lived to see his ideas bearing fruit
in the one way which of all others he would
have sought to avoid, namely in &ldquo;militancy&rdquo;
and terrorism. When in 1866, an attempt was
made by Karakozov to assassinate Alexander
II, and Herzen wrote an article repudiating
all political assassinations as barbarous, the
revolutionary parties solemnly denounced him
and his newspaper. <i>The Bell</i>, which had
already lost its popularity owing to Herzen&rsquo;s
pro-Polish sympathies in 1863, ceased to have
any circulation. Thus he lived to see his vast
hopes shattered, the seed he had sown bearing
a fruit he distrusted, his dreams of regeneration
burst like a bubble, his ideals exploited
by unscrupulous criminals. He died in 1870,
leaving a name which is as great in Russian
literature as it is remarkable in Russian
history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>154]</a></span>
Turning now to the <em>Slavophiles</em>, their idea
was that Russia was already in possession of
the best possible institutions,&mdash;orthodoxy,
autocracy, and communal ownership, and
that the West had everything to learn from
Russia. They pointed to the evils arising
from the feudal and aristocratic state, the
system of primogeniture in the West, the
higher legal status of women in Russia, and
the superiority of a communal system, which
leads naturally to a Consultative National
Assembly with unanimous decisions, over
the parliaments and party systems of the
West.</p>

<p>The leader of the Slavophiles was <span class="smcap">Homyakov</span>,
a man of great culture; a dialectician,
a poet, and an impassioned defender of
orthodoxy. The best of his lyrics, which are
inspired by a profound love of his country
and belief in it, have great depth of feeling.
Besides Homyakov, there were other poets,
such as <span class="smcap">Tyutchev</span> and <span class="smcap">Ivan Aksakov</span>. Just
as the camp of Reform produced in Herzen
a supreme writer of memoirs, that of the
Slavophiles also produced a unique memoir
writer in the <span class="smcap">Serge Aksakov</span>, the father of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>155]</a></span>
the poet (1791-1859), who published his
<i>Family Chronicle</i> in 1856, and who describes
the life of the end of the eighteenth century,
and the age of Alexander. This book, one of
the most valuable historical documents in
Russian, and a priceless collection of biographical
portraits, is also a gem of Russian
prose, exact in its observation, picturesque
and perfectly balanced in its diction.</p>

<p>Aksakov remembered with unclouded distinctness
exactly what he had seen in his childhood,
which he spent in the district of Orenburg.
He paints the portraits of his grandfather and
his great-aunt. We see every detail of the
life of a backwoodsman of the days of
Catherine II. We see the noble of those days,
simple and rustic in his habits as a peasant,
almost entirely unlettered, and yet a gentleman
through and through, unswerving in
maintaining the standard of morals and
traditions which he considers due to his ancient
lineage. We see every hour of the day of his
life in the country; we hear all the details of
the family life, the marriage of his son, the
domestic troubles of his sister.</p>

<p>What strikes one most, perhaps, besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>156]</a></span>
the contrast between the primitive simplicity
of the habits and manners of the life described,
and the astoundingly gentlemanlike feelings of
the man who leads this quiet and rustic life in
remote and backward conditions, is that there
is not a hint or suspicion of anything antiquated
in the sentiments and opinions we see
at play. The story of Aksakov&rsquo;s grandfather
might be that of any country gentleman in
any country, at any epoch, making allowances
for a certain difference in manners and
customs and conditions which were peculiar
to the epoch in question, the existence of
serfdom, for instance&mdash;although here, too, the
feeling with regard to manners described is
startlingly like the ideal of good manners of
any epoch, although the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">m&oelig;urs</i> are sometimes
different. The story is as vivid and as interesting
as that of any novel, as that of the
novels of Russian writers of genius, and it
has the additional value of being true. And
yet we never feel that Aksakov has a thought
of compiling a historical document for the
sake of its historical interest. He is making
history unawares, just as Monsieur Jourdain
talked prose without knowing it; and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>157]</a></span>
whether he was aware of it or not, he wrote
perfect prose. No more perfect piece of
prose writing exists. The style flows on like
a limpid river; there is nothing superfluous,
and not a hesitating touch. It is impossible
to put down the narrative after once beginning
it, and I have heard of children who
read it like a fairy-tale. One has the sensation,
in reading it, of being told a story by
some enchanting nurse, who, when the usual
question, &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; is put to her, could
truthfully answer, &ldquo;Yes, it is true.&rdquo; The
pictures of nature, the portraits of the people,
all the good and all the bad of the good and
the bad old times pass before one with epic
simplicity and the magic of a fairy-tale. One
is spellbound by the charm, the dignity, the
good-nature, the gentle, easy accent of the
speaker, in whom one feels convinced not only
that there was nothing common nor mean,
but to whom nothing was common or mean,
who was a gentleman by character as well
as by lineage, one of God&rsquo;s as well as one of
Russia&rsquo;s nobility.</p>

<p>There is no book in Russian which, for its
entrancing interest as well as for its historical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>158]</a></span>
value, so richly deserves translation into
English; only such a translation should be
made by a stylist&mdash;that is, by a man who
knows how to speak and write his mother
tongue perspicuously and simply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<br />
<small>THE EPOCH OF REFORM</small></h2>


<p>For seven years after the death of Belinsky
in 1848, all literary development ceased. This
period was the darkest hour before the dawn
of the second great renascence of Russian
literature. Criticism was practically non-existent;
the Slavophiles were forbidden to
write; the Westernizers were exiled. An
increased severity of censorship, an extreme
suspicion and drastic measures on the part
of the Government were brought about by
the fears which the Paris revolution of 1848
had caused. The Westernizers felt the
effects of this as much as the Slavophiles;
a group of young literary men, schoolmasters
and officers, the Petrashevtsy, called after
their leader, a Foreign Office official <span class="smcap">Petrashevsky</span>,
met together on Fridays and debated
on abstract subjects; they discussed
the emancipation of the serfs, read Fourier
and Lamennais, and considered the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>160]</a></span>
establishment of a secret press: the scheme of a
popular propaganda was thought of, but
nothing had got beyond talk&mdash;and the whole
thing was in reality only talk&mdash;when the
society was discovered by the police and its
members were punished with the utmost
severity. Twenty-one of them were condemned
to death, among whom was Dostoyevsky,
who, being on the army list, was accused
of treason. They were reprieved on the scaffold;
some sent into penal servitude in Siberia,
and some into the army. This marked one of
the darkest hours in the history of Russian
literature. And from this date until 1855,
complete stagnation reigned. In 1855 the
Emperor Nicholas died during the Crimean
War; and with the accession of his son
Alexander II, a new era dawned on Russian
literature, the Era of the Great Reforms.
The Crimean War and the reforms which
followed it&mdash;the emancipation of the serfs,
the creation of a new judicial system, and
the foundation of local self-government&mdash;stabbed
the Russian soul into life, relieved
it of its gag, produced a great outburst of
literature which enlarged and enriched the
literature of the world, and gave to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>161]</a></span>
world three of its greatest novelists: Turgenev,
Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ivan Turgenev</span> (1816-83), whose name is
of Tartar origin, came of an old family which
had frequently distinguished itself in the
annals of Russian literature by a fearless
outspokenness. He began his literary career
by writing verse (1843); but, like Maupassant,
he soon understood that verse was not his
true vehicle, and in 1847 gave up writing
verse altogether; in that year he published
in <i>The Contemporary</i> his first sketch of
peasant life, <i>Khor and Kalinych</i>, which afterwards
formed part of his <i>Sportsman&rsquo;s Sketches</i>,
twenty-four of which he collected and published
in 1852. The Government rendered
Turgenev the same service as it had done to
Pushkin, in exiling him to his own country
estate for two years. When, after the two
years, this forced exile came to an end, he
went into another kind of exile of his own
accord; he lived at first at Baden, and then
in Paris, and only reappeared in Russia from
time to time; this accounts for the fact that,
although Turgenev belongs chronologically
to the epoch of the great reforms, the Russia
which he paints was really more like the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>162]</a></span>
Russia before that epoch; and when he tried
to paint the Russia that was contemporary to
him his work gave rise to much controversy.</p>

<p>His <i>Rudin</i> was published in 1856, <i>The
Nest of Gentlefolk</i> in 1859, <i>On the Eve</i> in 1860,
<i>Fathers and Sons</i> in 1862, <i>Smoke</i> in 1867.
Turgenev did for Russian literature what
Byron did for English literature; he led
the genius of Russia on a pilgrimage throughout
all Europe. And in Europe his work
reaped a glorious harvest of praise. Flaubert
was astounded by him, George Sand looked
up to him as to a Master, Taine spoke of his
work as being the finest artistic production
since Sophocles. In Turgenev&rsquo;s work, Europe
not only discovered Turgenev, but it discovered
Russia, the simplicity and the naturalness
of the Russian character; and this came
as a revelation. For the first time, Europe
came across the Russian woman whom Pushkin
was the first to paint; for the first time
Europe came into contact with the Russian
soul; and it was the sharpness of this revelation
which accounts for the fact of Turgenev
having received in the West an even greater
meed of praise than he was perhaps entitled
to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>163]</a></span>
In Russia, Turgenev attained almost instant
popularity. His <i>Sportsman&rsquo;s Sketches</i>
made him known, and his <i>Nest of Gentlefolk</i>
made him not only famous but universally
popular. In 1862 the publication of his
masterpiece <i>Fathers and Sons</i> dealt his reputation
a blow. The revolutionary elements
in Russia regarded his hero, Bazarov, as a
calumny and a libel; whereas the reactionary
elements in Russia looked upon <i>Fathers and
Sons</i> as a glorification of Nihilism. Thus he
satisfied nobody. He fell between two stools.
This, perhaps, could only happen in Russia
to this extent; and for the same reason as
that which made Russian criticism didactic.
The conflicting elements of Russian society
were so terribly in earnest in fighting their
cause, that any one whom they did not regard
as definitely for them was at once considered
an enemy, and an impartial delineation of
any character concerned in the political
struggle was bound to displease both parties.
If a novelist drew a Nihilist, he must either be
a hero or a scoundrel, if either the revolutionaries
or the reactionaries were to be pleased.
If in England the militant suffragists suddenly
had a huge mass of educated opinion behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>164]</a></span>
them and a still larger mass of educated public
opinion against them, and some one were to
draw in a novel an impartial picture of a
suffragette, the same thing would happen.
On a small scale, as far as the suffragettes
are concerned, it has happened in the case
of Mr. Wells. But, if Turgenev&rsquo;s popularity
suffered a shock in Russia from which it with
difficulty recovered, in Western Europe it
went on increasing. Especially in England,
Turgenev became the idol of all that was
eclectic, and admiration for Turgenev a
hall-mark of good taste.</p>

<p>In Russia, Turgenev&rsquo;s work recovered from
the unpopularity caused by his <i>Fathers and
Sons</i> when Nihilism became a thing of the
past, and revolution took an entirely different
shape; but, with the growing up of new
generations, his popularity suffered in a
different way and for different reasons. A
new element came into Russian literature with
Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, and later with Gorky,
and Turgenev&rsquo;s work began to seem thin and
artificial beside the creations of these stronger
writers; but in Russia, where Turgenev&rsquo;s
work has the advantage of being read in the
original, it had an asset which ensured it a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
permanent and safe harbour, above and
beyond the fluctuations of literary taste, the
strife of political parties, and the conflict of
social ideals; and that was its art, its poetry,
its style, which ensured it a lasting and imperishable
niche among the great classics of
Russian literature. And there it stands now.
Turgenev&rsquo;s work in Russia is no longer disputed
or a subject of dispute. It is taken
for granted; and, whatever the younger
generation will read and admire, they will
always read and admire Turgenev first. His
work is a necessary part of the intellectual
baggage of any educated man and, especially,
of the educated adolescent.</p>

<p>The position of Tennyson in England offers
in a sense a parallel to that of Turgenev in
Russia. Tennyson, like Turgenev, enjoyed
during his lifetime not only the popularity
of the masses, but the appreciation of all that
was most eclectic in the country. Then a
reaction set in. Now I believe the young
generation think nothing of Tennyson at all.
And yet nothing is so sure as his permanent
place in English literature; and that permanent
place is secured to him by his incomparable
diction. So it is with Turgenev.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>166]</a></span>
One cannot expect the younger generation
to be wildly excited about Turgenev&rsquo;s ideas,
characters, and problems. They belong to an
epoch which is dead. At the same time, one
cannot help thinking that the most advanced
of the symbolist writers would not have been
sorry had he happened by chance to write
<i>Bezhin Meadow</i> and the <i>Poems in Prose</i>.
Just so one cannot help thinking that the
most modern of our poets, had he by accident
written <i>The Revenge</i> or <i>Tears, Idle Tears</i>,
would not have thrown them in the fire!</p>

<p>There is, indeed, something in common
between Tennyson and Turgenev. They both
have something mid-Victorian in them. They
are both idyllic, and both of them landscape-lovers
and lords of language. They neither of
them had any very striking message to preach;
they both of them seem to halt, except on rare
occasions, on the threshold of passion; they
both of them have a rare stamp of nobility; and
in both of them there is an element of banality.
They both seem to a certain extent to be shut
off from the world by the trees of old parks,
where cultivated people are enjoying the air
and the flowers and the shade, and where
between the tall trees you get glimpses of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>167]</a></span>
silvery landscapes and limpid waters, and
soft music comes from the gliding boat. Of
course, there is more than this in Turgenev,
but this is the main impression.</p>

<p>Pathos he has, of the finest, and passion he
describes beautifully from the outside, making
you feel its existence, but not convincing you
that he felt it himself; but on the other hand
what an artist he is! How beautifully his
pictures are painted; and how rich he is in
poetic feeling!</p>

<p>Turgenev is above all things a poet. He
carried on the work of Pushkin, and he did
for Russian prose what Pushkin did for
Russian poetry; he created imperishable
models of style. His language has the same
limpidity and absence of any blur that we
find in Pushkin&rsquo;s work. His women have
the same crystal radiance, transparent simplicity,
and unaffected strength; his pictures
of peasant life, and his country episodes
have the same truth to nature; as an artist
he had a severe sense of proportion, a perfect
purity of outline, and an absolute harmony
between the thought and the expression.
Now that modern Europe and England
have just begun to discover Dostoyevsky, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>168]</a></span>
possible that a reaction will set in to the
detriment of Turgenev. Indeed, to a certain
extent this reaction has set in in Western
Europe, as M. Haumant, one of Turgenev&rsquo;s
ablest critics and biographers, pointed out not
long ago. And, as the majority of Englishmen
have not the advantage of reading
him in the original, they will be unchecked
in this reaction, if it comes about, by their
appreciation of what is perhaps most durable
in his work. Yet to translate Turgenev adequately,
it would require an English poet
gifted with a sense of form and of words as
rare as that of Turgenev himself. However
this may be, there is no doubt about the
importance of Turgenev in the history of
Russian literature, whatever the future generations
in Russia or in Europe may think of his
work. He was a great novelist besides being
a great poet. Certainly he never surpassed
his early <i>Sportsman&rsquo;s Sketches</i> in freshness
of inspiration and the perfection of artistic
execution.</p>

<p>His <i>Bezhin Meadow</i>, where the children
tell each other bogey stories in the evening,
is a gem with which no other European literature
has anything to compare. <i>The Singers</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
<i>Death</i>, and many others are likewise incomparable.
<i>The Nest of Gentlefolk</i>, to which
Turgenev owed his great popularity, is quite
perfect of its kind, with its gallery of portraits
going back to the eighteenth century and to
the period of Alexander I; its lovable, human
hero Lavretsky, and Liza, a fit descendant of
Pushkin&rsquo;s Tatiana, radiant as a star. All
Turgenev&rsquo;s characters are alive; but, with
the exception of his women and the hero of
<i>Fathers and Sons</i>, they are alive in bookland
rather than in real life.</p>

<p>George Meredith&rsquo;s characters, for instance,
are alive, but they belong to a land or rather
a planet of his own making, and we should
never recognize Sir Willoughby Patterne in the
street, but we do meet women sometimes who
remind us of Clara Middleton and Carinthia
Jane. The same is true with regard to
Turgenev, although it is not another planet
he created, but a special atmosphere and epoch
to which his books exclusively belong, and
which some critics say never existed at all.
That is of no consequence. It exists for us
in his work.</p>

<p>But perhaps what gave rise to accusations
of unreality and caricature against Turgenev&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>170]</a></span>
characters, apart from the intenser reality
of Tolstoy&rsquo;s creations, by comparison with
which Turgenev&rsquo;s suffered, was that Turgenev,
while professing to describe the present, and
while believing that he was describing the
present, was in reality painting an epoch
that was already dead. <i>Rudin</i>, <i>Smoke</i>, and
<i>On the Eve</i> have suffered more from the
passage of time. <i>Rudin</i> is a pathetic picture
of the type that Turgenev was so fond
of depicting, the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">g&eacute;nie sans portefeuille</i>, a
latter-day Hamlet who can only unpack his
heart with words, and with his eloquence
persuade others to believe in him, and succeed
even in persuading himself to believe
in himself, until the moment for action
comes, when he breaks down. The subjects
of <i>Smoke</i> and <i>Spring Waters</i> are almost
identical; but, whereas <i>Spring Waters</i> is one
of the most poetical of Turgenev&rsquo;s achievements,
<i>Smoke</i> seems to-day the most banal,
and almost to deserve Tolstoy&rsquo;s criticism:
&ldquo;In <i>Smoke</i> there is hardly any love of anything,
and very little pity; there is only love
of light and playful adultery; and therefore
the poetry of that novel is repulsive.&rdquo; <i>On the
Eve</i>, which tells of a Bulgarian on the eve of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>171]</a></span>
the liberation of his country, suffers from
being written at a time when real Russians
were hard at work at that very task; and it
was on this account that the novel found little
favour in Russia, as the fiction paled beside
the reality.</p>

<p>It was followed by Turgenev&rsquo;s masterpiece,
for which time can only heighten one&rsquo;s
admiration. <i>Fathers and Sons</i> is as beautifully
constructed as a drama of Sophocles;
the events move inevitably to a tragic close.
There is not a touch of banality from beginning
to end, and not an unnecessary word; the
portraits of the old father and mother, the
young Kirsanov, and all the minor characters
are perfect; and amidst the trivial
crowd, Bazarov stands out like Lucifer, the
strongest&mdash;the only strong character&mdash;that
Turgenev created, the first Nihilist&mdash;for if
Turgenev was not the first to invent the word,
he was the first to apply it in this sense.</p>

<p>Bazarov is the incarnation of the Lucifer
type that recurs again and again in Russian
history and fiction, in sharp contrast to the
meek humble type of Ivan Durak. Lermontov&rsquo;s
Pechorin was in some respects an
anticipation of Bazarov; so were the many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
Russian rebels. He is the man who denies,
to whom art is a silly toy, who detests abstractions,
knowledge, and the love of Nature;
he believes in nothing; he bows to nothing;
he can break, but he cannot bend; he does
break, and that is the tragedy, but, breaking,
he retains his invincible pride, and</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;not cowardly he puts off his helmet,&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and he dies &ldquo;valiantly vanquished.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the pages which describe his death Turgenev
reaches the high-water mark of his art,
his moving quality, his power, his reserve.
For manly pathos they rank among the
greatest scenes in literature, stronger than the
death of Colonel Newcome and the best of
Thackeray. Among English novelists it is,
perhaps, only Meredith who has struck such
strong, piercing chords, nobler than anything
in Daudet or Maupassant, more reserved than
anything in Victor Hugo, and worthy of the
great poets, of the tragic pathos of Goethe and
Dante. The character of Bazarov, as has been
said, created a sensation and endless controversy.
The revolutionaries thought him a
caricature and a libel, the reactionaries a
scandalous glorification of the Devil; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>173]</a></span>
impartial men such as Dostoyevsky, who knew
the revolutionaries at first hand, thought the
type unreal. It is possible that Bazarov was
not like the Nihilists of the sixties; but in
any case as a figure in fiction, whatever the
fact may be, he lives and will continue to live.</p>

<p>In <i>Virgin Soil</i>, Turgenev attempted to
paint the underground revolutionary movement;
here, in the opinion of all Russian
judges, he failed. The revolutionaries considered
their portraits here more unreal than
that of Bazarov; the Conservatives were
grossly caricatured; the hero Nezhdanov
was a type of a past world, another Rudin,
and not in the least like&mdash;so those who knew
them tell us&mdash;the revolutionaries of the day.
Solomin, the energetic character in the book,
was considered as unreal as Nezhdanov.
The wife of the reactionary Sipyagin is a
<i>pastiche</i> of the female characters of that type
in his other books; cleverly drawn, but a
completely conventional book character. The
redeeming feature in the book is Mariana, the
heroine, one of Turgenev&rsquo;s finest ideal women;
and it is full, of course, of gems of descriptive
writing. The book was a complete failure,
and after this Turgenev went back to writing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>174]</a></span>
short stories. The result was a great disappointment
to Turgenev, who had thought
that, by writing a novel dealing with actual
life, he would please and reconcile all parties.
To this later epoch belong his matchless
<i>Poems in Prose</i>, one of the latest melodies
he sounded, a melody played on one string
of the lyre, but whose sweetness contained the
essence of all his music.</p>

<p>Turgenev&rsquo;s work has a historic as well as
an artistic value. He painted the Russian
gentry, and the type of gentry that was disappearing,
as no one else has done. His
landscape painting has been dwelt on; one
ought, perhaps, to add that, beautiful as it
is, it still belongs to the region of conventional
landscape painting; his landscape is the
orthodox Russian landscape, and is that
of the age of Pushkin, in which no bird
except a nightingale is mentioned, no flower
except a rose. This convention was not
really broken in prose until the advent of
Gorky.</p>

<p>Reviewing Turgenev&rsquo;s work as a whole,
any one who goes back to his books after a
time, and after a course of more modern and
rougher, stormier literature, will, I think, be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
surprised at its excellence and perhaps be
inclined to heave a deep sigh of relief. Some
of it will appear conventional; he will notice
a faint atmosphere of rose-water; he will
feel, if he has been reading the moderns, as a
traveller feels who, after an exciting but
painful journey, through dangerous ways and
unpleasant surroundings, suddenly enters a
cool garden, where fountains sob between
dark cypresses, and swans float majestically
on artificial lakes. There is an aroma of
syringa in the air; the pleasaunce is artistically
laid out, and full of fragrant flowers.
But he will not despise that garden for its
elegance and its tranquil seclusion, for its
trees cast large shadows; the nightingale
sings in its thickets, the moon silvers the calm
statues, and the sound of music on the waters
goes to the heart. Turgenev reminds one of
a certain kind of music, beautiful in form, not
too passionate and yet full of emotion, Schumann&rsquo;s
music, for instance; if Pushkin is the
Mozart of Russian literature, Turgenev is the
Schumann; not amongst the very greatest,
but still a poet, full of inspired lyrical feeling;
and a great, a classic artist, the prose Virgil
of Russian literature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>176]</a></span>
What Turgenev did for the country gentry,
<span class="smcap">Goncharov</span> (1812-91) did for the St.
Petersburg gentry. The greater part of his
work deals with the forties. Goncharov, a
noble (<i>dvoryanin</i>) by education, and according
to his own account by descent, though according
to another account he was of merchant
extraction, entered the Government service,
and then went round the world in a frigate,
a journey which he described in letters. Of
his three novels, <i>The Everyday Story</i>, <i>Oblomov</i>,
and <i>The Landslip</i>, <i>Oblomov</i> is the most
famous: in it he created a type which became
immortal; and Oblomov has passed into the
Russian language just as Tartuffe has passed
into the French language, or Pecksniff into
the English language. A chapter of the book
appeared in 1849, and the whole novel in
1859.</p>

<p>Oblomov is the incarnation of what in
Russia is called <i>Halatnost</i>, which means the
propensity to live in dressing-gown and
slippers. It is told of Krylov, who was an
Oblomov of real life, and who spent most of his
time lying on a sofa, that one day somebody
pointed out to him that the nail on which
a picture was hanging just over the sofa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>177]</a></span>
on which he was lying, was loose, and that the
picture would probably fall on his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
said Krylov, not getting up, &ldquo;the picture will
fall just beyond the sofa. I know the angle.&rdquo;
The apathy of Oblomov, although to the outward
eye it resembles this mere physical inertness,
is subtly different. Krylov&rsquo;s apathy was
the laziness of a man whose brain brought
forth concrete fruits; and who feels neither
the inclination nor the need of any other
exercise, either physical or intellectual. Oblomov&rsquo;s
apathy is that of a brain seething
with the burning desires of a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vie intime</i>,
which all comes to nothing owing to a kind
of spiritual paralysis, &ldquo;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">une infirmit&eacute; morale</span>.&rdquo;
It is true he finds it difficult to put on
his socks, still more to get up, when he
is awake, impossible to change his rooms
although the ceiling is falling to bits, and
impossible not to lie on the sofa most of the
day; but the reason of this obstinate inertia
is not mere physical disinclination, it is the
result of a mixture of seething and simmering
aspirations, indefinite disillusions and apprehensions,
that elude the grasp of the will.
Oblomov is really the victim of a dream, of
an aspiration, of an ideal as bright and mobile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>178]</a></span>
as a will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp, as elusive as thistledown,
which refuses to materialize.</p>

<p>The tragedy of the book lies in the effort
he makes to rise from his slough of apathy,
or rather the effort his friends encourage him
to make. Oblomov&rsquo;s heart is made of pure
gold; his soul is of transparent crystal; there
is not a base flaw in the paste of his composition;
yet his will is sapped, not by words,
words, words, but by the inability to formulate
the shadows of his inner life. His friend
is an energetic German-Russian. He introduces
Oblomov to a charming girl, and together
they conspire to drag him from his apathy.
The girl, Olga, at first succeeds; she falls in
love with him, and he with her; he wants to
marry her, but he cannot take the necessary
step of arranging his affairs in a manner
which would make that marriage possible; and
gradually he falls back into a new stage of
apathy worse than the first; she realizes the
hopelessness of the situation, and they agree
to separate. She marries the energetic friend,
and Oblomov sinks into the comforts of a
purely negative life of complete inaction and
seclusion, watched over by a devoted housekeeper,
whom he ultimately marries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>179]</a></span>
The extraordinary subtlety of the psychology
of this study lies, as well as in other
things, in the way in which we feel that Olga
is not really happy with her excellent husband;
he is the man whom she respects; but Oblomov
is the man whom she loves, till the end; and
she would give worlds to respect him too if he
would only give her the chance. Oblomov
often defends his stagnation, while realizing
only too well what a misfortune it is; and
we sometimes feel that he is not altogether
wrong. The chapter that tells of his dream
in which his past life and childhood arise
before him in a haze of serene laziness is
one of the masterpieces of Russian prose.
The book is terribly real, and almost intolerably
sad.</p>

<p>Goncharov&rsquo;s third and last novel deals
with the life of a landed proprietor on the
Volga, and its main idea is the contrast
between the old generation before the reforms
and the new generation of Alexander II&rsquo;s
day&mdash;a paler <i>Fathers and Sons</i>.</p>

<p>To go back to criticism, the name of
<span class="smcap">Bakunin</span>, the apostle of destruction and the
incarnation of Russian Nihilism, belongs to
history; that of <span class="smcap">Grigoriev</span> must be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>180]</a></span>
mentioned as founding a school of thought which
preached the union of arts with the national
soil; he exercised a strong influence over
Dostoyevsky. <span class="smcap">Katkov</span>, whose influence was
at one time immense, originally belonged
to the circle of Herzen and Bakunin; he
became a professor of philosophy, but was
driven from his chair in the reaction of &rsquo;48,
and, being banished from erudition, he took up
a journalistic career and became the Editor
of the <i>Moscow News</i>. He was a Slavophile,
and when the rising in Poland broke out,
he headed the great wave of nationalist
feeling which passed over the country at that
time; he doubled the number of his subscribers,
and dealt a death-blow to Herzen&rsquo;s
<i>Bell</i>. After 1866, he headed reactionary
journalism and became a Nationalist of the
narrowest kind; but he was of a higher
calibre than the Nationalists of later days.
Slavophile critics of another kind were <span class="smcap">Strakhov</span>
and <span class="smcap">Danilevsky</span>, like Dostoyevsky,
disciples of Grigoriev, who preached the last
word of Slavophilism and were opposed to all
foreign innovations.</p>

<p>On the Radical side the leaders were
<span class="smcap">Chernyshevsky</span>, <span class="smcap">Dobrolyubov</span> and <span class="smcap">Pisarev</span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
Chernyshevsky, who translated John Stuart
Mill, and published a treatise on the &aelig;sthetic
relations of art and reality, served a sentence
of seven years&rsquo; hard labour and of twenty
years&rsquo; exile. His criticism&mdash;socialist propaganda,
and an attack on all metaphysics&mdash;does
not belong to literature, but his novel
<i>Shto dielat</i>&mdash;&ldquo;What is to be done?&rdquo;&mdash;had
an immense influence on his generation. It
deals with Nihilism. Dobrolyubov, who died
when he was twenty-four, belonged to the
same realistic school. His main theory was
that Russian literature is dominated by
Oblomov; that Chatsky, Pechorin, and Rudin
are all Oblomovs. Both Pisarev and Dobrolyubov
followed Chernyshevsky in his
realistic philosophy, in his rejection of metaphysics,
in his theory that beauty is to be
sought in life only, and that the sole duty of
art is to help to illustrate life. Pisarev recognized
that Turgenev&rsquo;s Bazarov was a picture
of himself, and he was pleased with the portrait.
Both Pisarev and Dobrolyubov died young.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vladimir Soloviev</span> (1853-1900), critic as
well as poet, moral philosopher, and theologian,
is one of the most interesting figures in
Russian literature. What is most remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>182]</a></span>
about him, and what makes him stand out, a
radiant exception in Russian criticism, is his
absolute independence. He belonged to no
camp; he was a slave to no party cry; utterly
unselfish, his sole aim was to seek after the
truth for the sake of truth, and to proclaim
it. In an age of positivism, he was a believing
Christian, and the dream of his life
was a union of the Eastern and Western
Churches. He deals with this idea in a book
which he wrote in French and published in
Paris: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L&rsquo;&Eacute;glise Russe et l&rsquo;&Eacute;glise Universelle</i>.
He admired the older Slavophiles, but he
severely attacked the Nationalists, such as
Katkov. His range of subjects was great,
and his style was brilliant; like many great
thinkers, he was far ahead of his time, and
in his criticism of the <i>Intelligentsia</i> anticipated
some tendencies, which have become visible
since the revolution of 1905. He reminds one
at times of Mr. A.&nbsp;J. Balfour, and even of
Mr. G.&nbsp;K. Chesterton, with whose &ldquo;orthodoxy&rdquo;
he would have much sympathy; and
he deals with questions such as Woman&rsquo;s
Suffrage in a way which exactly fits the present
day. He never became a Catholic, holding
that the Eastern Church <i>qua</i> Church had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>183]</a></span>
never been cut off from the West, and that
only one definite schism had been condemned;
but he believed in the necessity of a universal
Church. He was the first intellectual
Russian to point out to a generation which
took atheism as a matter of course that they
were possibly inferior instead of superior to
religion. He believed in Russia; he had
nothing against the Slavophile theory that
Russia had a divine mission; only he wished
to see that mission divinely performed. He
believed in the East of Christ, and not in that
of Xerxes. He died in 1900, before he had
finished his <i>Magnum Opus</i>, a work on moral
philosophy written on a religious basis. He
preached self-effacement; pity towards one&rsquo;s
fellow men; and reverence towards the supernatural.
His whole work is a defence of
moral principles, written with the soul of
a poet, the knowledge of a scholar, and
the brilliance of a dialectician. It is only
lately that his books have gained the appreciation
which they deserve; they are certainly
more in harmony with the present generation
than with that of the sixties and the
seventies. His <i>Three Conversations</i> has been
translated into English. Vladimir Soloviev
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>184]</a></span>
stands in a niche of his own, isolated from the
crowd by his own originality, his brilliance,
and his prematurity; he was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">intempestivus</i>.</p>

<p>To the same epoch belong four other important
writers, each occupying a place apart
from the current stream of literary or political
influences: one because he was a satirist,
one because he wrote for the stage, and the
two others because one impartially, and the
other bitterly, dared to criticize the Radicals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Michael Saltykov</span> (1826-89), who wrote
under the name of Shchedrin, holds a unique
place in Russian literature, not only because
he is a writer of genius, but because he is one
of the world&rsquo;s great satirists. Unlike Russian
satirists before him, Krylov, Gogol, and
Griboyedov, good-humoured irony or sharp
rapier thrusts of wit do not suffice him; he
has in himself the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">saeva indignatio</i>, and he
expresses it with all the concentrated spite
that he can muster, which is all the more
deadly from being used with perfect control.
His work is bulky, and fills eleven thick
volumes; some of it is quite out of date and
at the present day almost unintelligible; but
all that deals with the fundamental essentials
of the Russian character, and not with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>185]</a></span>
passing episodes of the day, has the freshness
of immortality. At the outset of his career,
he was banished to Vyatka, where he remained
from 1848-56, an exile, which gave him a rich
store of priceless material. His experiences
appeared in his <i>Sketches of Provincial Life</i>
in 1886-7.</p>

<p>He describes the good old times and the
officials of the good old times, with diabolic
malice and with an unequalled eye for the
ironical, the comic, the topsy-turvy, and the
true; and while he is as observant as Gogol,
he is as bitter as Swift. He puts his characters
on the stage and makes them relate
their experiences; thus we hear how the
collector of the dues manages to combine
the maximum amount of robbery with the
minimum amount of inconvenience. In his
pictures of prison life, the prisoners tell
their own stories, sometimes with unaffected
frankness, sometimes with startling cynicism,
and sometimes the story is obscured by
a whole heap of lies. The prisoners are of
different classes; one is an ex-official who
states that he was a statistician who got into
trouble over his figures; wishing to levy dues
on a peasant&rsquo;s property, he had demanded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>186]</a></span>
the number, not of their bee-hives, but of
their bees, and wrote in his list: &ldquo;The
peasant Sidorov possesses two horses, three
cows, nine sheep, one calf, and thirty-nine
thousand nine hundred and ninety-seven
bees.&rdquo; Unfortunately he was betrayed by
the police inspector.</p>

<p>Saltykov&rsquo;s satire deals entirely with the
middle class, the high officials, the average
official, and the minor public servants; and his
best-known work, and one that has not aged
any more than Swift has aged, is his <i>History
of a City according to the original documents</i>.</p>

<p>In this he tells of the city of <i>Glupov</i>, <i>Fool-City</i>,
where the people were such fools that
they were not content until they found some
one to rule them who was stupider than they
were themselves. The various phases Russia
had gone through are touched off; the mania
for regulations, the formalism, the official red-tape,
the persecution of independent thought,
and the oppression of original thinkers and
writers; the ultimate ideal is that introduced
by the last ruler of Glupov (the history lasts
from 1731 to 1826), of turning the country into
barracks and reducing every one and everything
to one level&mdash;in which the r&eacute;gime of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
the period of Nicholas I is satirized; until in
the final picture, as fine in its way as Pope&rsquo;s
close of the <i>Dunciad</i>, the stream rises, and
refusing to be stopped by the dam, carries
everything away. The style parodies that
of the ancient chroniclers; and its chief
intent lies not in the satirizing of any particular
events or person, but in the shafts of light,
sometimes bitter, and sometimes inexpressibly
droll, it throws on the Russian system of
administration and on the Russian character.</p>

<p>In his <i>Pompaduri</i>, Saltykov dissects and
vivisects the higher official,&mdash;the big-wig,&mdash;and
in his sketches from the &ldquo;Domain of
Moderation and Accuracy,&rdquo; he writes, in
little, the epic of the minor public servant&mdash;the
man who is never heard of, who is included
in the term of &ldquo;the rest,&rdquo; but who, nevertheless,
is a cogwheel in the machinery, without
which the big-wigs cannot act or execute.
No more supreme piece of art than this piece
of satire exists. The typical minor official
is drawn in all the variations of his miserable
and pitiable species, and in all the phases
of his ignoble and sometimes tragical career,
with a pen dipped in scorn and stinging
malice, not unblent with a grave pity, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>188]</a></span>
always exists in the work of the greatest
satirists&mdash;&ldquo;Peace to all such, but there was
one ...&rdquo; for instance&mdash;and wielded with
terrible certainty of touch. This epic of the
<i>Molchalins</i> of life&mdash;the typical officials who
cease to be men&mdash;was the story of a great
part of the Russian population; and in its
essence, a great deal of it remains true to-day,
while all of it remains artistically enjoyable.</p>

<p>Saltykov continued to write during the
whole of his long life. His field of satire
ranges from the days before serfdom to
the epoch of the reforms, extends to the
days of the Russo-Turkish War, and passes
the frontier into the West. It is impossible
here even to name all his works; but there
is one, written in the decline of his life, which
has a solid historical as well as a rich and
varied artistic interest. This is his <i>Poshenkhonskaya
Starina</i>; it is practically the
history of his childhood, his upbringing, and
the state of affairs which existed at that
time, the life lived by his parents and
their neighbours, the landed proprietors and
their serfs. With amazing impartiality, without
exaggeration, and yet with evidences
of deep feeling and passionate indignation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>189]</a></span>
all the more striking from being both rare and
expressed with reserve, he paints on a large
and crowded canvas the life of the masters
and their serfs. A long gallery of men and
women is opened to one; tragedy, comedy,
farce, all are here&mdash;in fact, life&mdash;life as it was
then in a remote corner of the country. Here
Saltykov&rsquo;s spite and malice give way to higher
strokes of tragic irony and pity; and the
work has dignity as well as power In the
bulk of Saltykov&rsquo;s early work there is much
dross, much venom, and much ephemeral
tinsel that has faded; the stuff of this book is
stern and enduring; its subject-matter would
not lose a particle of interest in translation.
The Russians have been ungrateful towards
Saltykov, and have been inclined to neglect
his work, the lasting element of which is one
of the most original, precious, and remarkable
possessions of Russian literature.</p>

<p>The complement of Saltykov is <span class="smcap">Leskov</span> (or,
as he originally called himself, <i>Stebnitsky</i>).
The character of his work, its reception by
the reading public on the one hand, and by
the professional critics on the other, is one
of the most striking object-lessons in the
history of Russian literature and Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>190]</a></span>
literary criticism. Leskov has been long
ago recognized by educated Russia as a writer
of the first rank; what is best in his work,
which is bulky and unequal, has the unmistakable
hall-mark of the classics; he is with
Gogol and Saltykov, and the novelists of the
first rank. Educated Russia is fully aware
of this. Nobody disputes Leskov his place,
nor denies him his supreme artistic talent,
his humour, his vividness, his colour, his
satire, the depth of his feeling, the richness
of his invention. In spite of this, there is no
Russian writer who has so acutely suffered
from the didactic and partisan quality of
Russian criticism.</p>

<p>His literary career began in 1860. Like
Saltykov, he paints the period of transition
that followed the epoch of the great Reforms.
In spite of this, as late as 1902, no critical
biography, no serious work of criticism, had
been devoted to his books. All Russia had
read him, but literary criticism had ignored
him. It is as if English literary criticism had
ignored Dickens until 1900.</p>

<p>The reason of this neglect is not far to
seek. Saltykov was an independent thinker;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>191]</a></span>
he belonged to no literary or political camp;
he criticized the partisans of both camps
with equal courage; and the partisans could
not and did not forgive him. Like Saltykov,
Leskov saw what was going on in Russia;
with penetrating insight and observation
he realized the evils of the old order; like
Saltykov, he was filled with indignation,
and perhaps to a greater degree than Saltykov,
he was filled with pity. But, whereas Saltykov&rsquo;s
work was purely destructive&mdash;an onslaught
of brooms in the Augean stables&mdash;Leskov
begins where Saltykov ends. Like
Saltykov and like Gogol before him, the old
order inspires him with laughter, sometimes
with bitter laughter, at the absurdities of the
old r&eacute;gime and its results; but he does not confine
himself to destructive irony and sapping
satire. With <span class="smcap">Pisemsky</span>, another writer of first-class
talent, of the same epoch, Leskov was
the first Russian novelist&mdash;Griboyedov had
already anticipated such criticism in <i>Gore ot
Uma</i>, in his delineation of Chatsky,&mdash;to have
the courage to criticize the reformers, the
men of the new epoch; and his criticism was
not only negative but creative; he realized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>192]</a></span>
that everything must be &ldquo;reformed altogether.&rdquo;
He then asked himself whether the
new men, who were engaged in the task of
reform, were equal to their task. He came
to the conclusion not only that they were
inadequate, but that they were setting about
the business the wrong way, and he had the
courage to say so. He was the first Russian
novelist to say he disbelieved in Liberals,
although he believed in Liberalism; and this
was a sentiment which no Liberal in Russia
could admit then, and one which they can
scarcely admit now.</p>

<p>His criticism of the Liberals was creative,
and not negative, in this: that, instead of
confining himself to pointing out their weakness
and the mistaken course they were taking,
he did his best to point out the right path.
Dostoyevsky was likewise subjected to the
same ostracism. Turgenev suffered from it;
but the genius of Dostoyevsky and the art
of Turgenev overstepped the limits of all
barriers and frontiers. Europe acclaimed
them. Leskov&rsquo;s criticism being more local,
the ostracism, although powerless to prevent
the popularity of his work in Russia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>193]</a></span>
succeeded for a time in keeping him from the
notice of Western Europe. This barrier is now
being broken down. One of Leskov&rsquo;s masterpieces,
<i>The Sealed Angel</i>, was lately translated
into English; but he is one of the most difficult
authors to translate because he is one of the
most native.</p>

<p>A far bitterer and more pessimistic note is
heard in the work of Pisemsky. He attacks
the new democracy mercilessly, and not
from any predilection towards the old. His
most important work, <i>The Troubled Sea</i> (1862),
was a terrific onslaught on Radical Russia;
and Pisemsky paid the same price for his
pessimistic analysis as Leskov did for his
impartiality, namely social ostracism.</p>

<p>The work of <span class="smcap">Ostrovsky</span> (1823-86) belongs
to the history of the Stage, to which he brought
slices of real life from the middle class; the
townsmen, the minor public servants, merchants
great and small, and rogues, a <i>milieu</i>
which he had observed in his youth, his father
having been an attorney to a Moscow merchant.
Ostrovsky may be called the founder of
modern Russian realistic comedy and drama.
In spite of the epoch at which his plays were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>194]</a></span>
written (the fifties and the sixties), there is
not a trace of <i>Scribisme</i>, no tricks, no effective
exits or curtains; he thus anticipated the
form of the quite modern drama by about
seventy years. His plays hold the stage now
in Russia, and form part of the stock repertories
every season. They give, moreover, just
the same lifelike impression whether read or
seen acted; and they are as interesting from
a literary as they are from a historical or
dramatic point of view, interesting because
they are intensely national, and as Russian
as beer is English.</p>

<p>This brief summary of the epoch would be
still more incomplete than it is without the
mention of yet another novelist, <span class="smcap">Grigorovich</span>.
Although on a lower level of art and creative
power than Pisemsky and Leskov, he was
the pioneer in Russian literature of peasant
literature. He anticipated Turgenev&rsquo;s <i>Sportsman&rsquo;s
Sketches</i>, and for the first time made
Russian readers cry with sympathy over the
annals of the peasant. Like Turgenev, he
was a great landscape painter. In his
&ldquo;Fishermen&rdquo; he paints the peasant and the
artisan&rsquo;s life, and in his &ldquo;Country Roads&rdquo;
he gives a picture of the good old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>195]</a></span>
times&mdash;replete with rich humour, and in sharp contrast
to Saltykov&rsquo;s sunless and trenchant
etching of the same period. Humour, the
pathos of the poor, landscape&mdash;these are his
chief qualities.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<br />
<small>TOLSTOY AND DOSTOYEVSKY</small></h2>


<p>With <span class="smcap">Tolstoy</span> and <span class="smcap">Dostoyevsky</span>, we
come not only to the two great pillars of
modern Russian literature which tower above
all others like two colossal statues in the
desert, but to two of the greatest figures in the
literature of the world. Russia has not given
the world a universal poet, a Shakespeare,
a Dante, a Goethe, or a Moli&egrave;re; for Pushkin,
consummate artist and inspired poet as he
was, lacks that peculiar greatness which
conquers all demarcations of frontier and
difference of language, and produces work
which becomes a part of the universal inheritance
of all nations; but Russia has given
us two prose-writers whose work has done
this very thing. And between them they sum
up in themselves the whole of the Russian
soul, and almost the whole of the Russian
character; I say almost the whole of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>197]</a></span>
Russian <em>character</em>, because although between
them they sum up all that is greatest, deepest,
and all that is weakest in the Russian <em>soul</em>,
there is perhaps one element of the Russian
<em>character</em>, which, although they understood it
well enough, their genius forbade them to
possess. If you take as ingredients Peter the
Great, Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s Mwyshkin&mdash;the idiot,
the pure fool who is wiser than the wise&mdash;and
the hero of Gogol&rsquo;s <i>Revisor</i>, Hlestyakov the liar
and wind-bag, you can, I think, out of these
elements, reconstitute any Russian who has
ever lived. That is to say, you will find that
every single Russian is compounded either of
one or more of these elements.</p>

<p>For instance, mix Peter the Great with a
sufficient dose of Hlestyakov, and you get
Boris Godunov and Bakunin; leave the
Peter the Great element unmixed, and you
get Bazarov, and many of Gorky&rsquo;s heroes;
mix it slightly with Hlestyakov, and you get
Lermontov; let the Hlestyakov element predominate,
and you get Griboyedov&rsquo;s Molchalin;
let the Mwyshkin element predominate,
with a dose of Hlestyakov, and you get Father
Gapon; let it predominate without the dose
of Hlestyakov, and you get Oblomov; mix
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>198]</a></span>
it with a dose of Peter the Great, you get
Herzen, Chatsky; and so on. Mix all the
elements equally, and you get Onegin, the
average man. I do not mean that there are
necessarily all these elements in every Russian,
but that you will meet with no Russian in
whom there is not to be found either one or
more than one of them.</p>

<p>Now, in Tolstoy, the Peter the Great element
dominates, with a dose of Mwyshkin, and a
vast but unsuccessful aspiration towards the
complete characteristics of Mwyshkin; while
in Dostoyevsky the Mwyshkin predominates,
blent with a fiery streak of Peter the Great;
but in neither of them is there a touch of
Hlestyakov. In Russia, it constantly happens
that a man in any class, be he a soldier, sailor,
tinker, tailor, rich man, poor man, plough-boy,
or thief, will suddenly leave his profession and
avocation and set out on the search for God
and for truth. These men are called <i>Bogoiskateli</i>,
Seekers after God. The one fact that
the whole world knows about Tolstoy is that,
in the midst of his great and glorious artistic
career, he suddenly abjured literature and art,
denounced worldly possessions, and said that
truth was to be found in working like a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
peasant, and thus created a sect of Tolstoyists.
The world then blamed him for inconsistency
because he went on writing, and lived as before,
with his family and in his own home. But in
reality there was no inconsistency, because
there was in reality no break. Tolstoy had
been a <i>Bogoiskatel</i>, a seeker after truth and
God all his life; it was only the manner of
his search which had changed; but the quest
itself remained unchanged; he was unable,
owing to family ties, to push his premises to
their logical conclusion until just before his
death; but push them to their logical conclusion
he did at the last, and he died, as we
know, on the road to a monastery.</p>

<p>Tolstoy&rsquo;s manner of search was extraordinary,
extraordinary because he was provided
for it with the eyes of an eagle which
enabled him to see through everything; and,
as he took nothing for granted from the day
he began his career until the day he died, he
was always subjecting people, objects, ideas, to
the searchlight of his vision, and testing them
to see whether they were true or not; moreover,
he was gifted with the power of describing
what he saw during this long journey
through the world of fact and the world of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>200]</a></span>
ideas, whether it were the general or the
particular, the mass or the detail, the vision,
the panorama, the crowd, the portrait or the
miniature, with the strong simplicity of a
Homer, and the colour and reality of a
Velasquez. This made him one of the world&rsquo;s
greatest writers, and the world&rsquo;s greatest
artist in narrative fiction. Another peculiarity
of his search was that he pursued it with
eagle eyes, but with blinkers.</p>

<p>In 1877 Dostoyevsky wrote: &ldquo;In spite of
his colossal artistic talent, Tolstoy is one of
those Russian minds which only see that which
is right before their eyes, and thus press towards
that point. They have not the power
of turning their necks to the right or to the
left to see what lies on one side; to do this,
they would have to turn with their whole
bodies. If they do turn, they will quite
probably maintain the exact opposite of what
they have been hitherto professing; for they
are rigidly honest.&rdquo; It is this search carried
on by eyes of unsurpassed penetration between
blinkers, by a man who every now and
then did turn his whole body, which accounts
for the many apparent changes and contradictions
of Tolstoy&rsquo;s career.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>201]</a></span>
Another source of contradiction was that
by temperament the Lucifer element predominated
in him, and the ideal he was for
ever seeking was the humility of Mwyshkin,
the pure fool, an ideal which he could not
reach, because he could not sufficiently humble
himself. Thus when death overtook him
he was engaged on his last and his greatest
voyage of discovery; and there is something
solemn and great about his having met with
death at a small railway station.</p>

<p>Tolstoy&rsquo;s works are a long record of this
search, and of the memories and experiences
which he gathered on the way. There is not a
detail, not a phase of feeling, not a shade or
mood in his spiritual life that he has not told
us of in his works. In his <i>Childhood, Boyhood
and Youth</i>, he re-creates his own childhood,
boyhood and youth, not always exactly as it
happened in reality; there is <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dichtung</i> as well
as <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wahrheit</i>; but the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Dichtung</i> is as true as
the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wahrheit</i>, because his aim was to recreate
the impressions he had received from his early
surroundings. Moreover, the searchlight of
his eyes even then fell mercilessly upon everything
that was unreal, sham and conventional.</p>

<p>As soon as he had finished with his youth,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>202]</a></span>
he turned to the life of a grown-up man in
<i>The Morning of a Landowner</i>, and told how
he tried to live a landowner&rsquo;s life, and
how nothing but dissatisfaction came of it.
He escapes to the Caucasus, and seeks regeneration,
and the result of the search here
is a masterpiece, <i>The Cossacks</i>. He goes back
to the world, and takes part in the Crimean
war; he describes what he saw in a battery;
his eagle eye lays bare the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">splendeurs et
mis&egrave;res</i> of war more truthfully perhaps than
a writer on war has ever done, but less sympathetically
than Alfred de Vigny&mdash;the difference
being that Alfred de Vigny is innately
modest, and that Tolstoy, as he wrote himself,
at the beginning of the war, &ldquo;had no
modesty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After the Crimean war, he plunges again
into the world and travels abroad; and on his
return to Russia, he settles down at Yasnaya
Polyana and marries. The hero of his novel
<i>Domestic Happiness</i> appears to have found his
heart&rsquo;s desire in marriage and country life.
It was then that he wrote <i>War and Peace</i>,
which he began to publish in 1865. He always
had the idea of writing a story on the Decembrist
movement, and <i>War and Peace</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>203]</a></span>
perhaps the preface to that unwritten work,
for it ends when that movement was beginning.
In <i>War and Peace</i>, he gave the world a modern
prose epic, which did not suffer from the
drawback that spoils most historical novels,
namely, that of being obviously false, because
it was founded on his own recollection of his
parents&rsquo; memories. He gives us what we feel
to be the very truth; for the first time in an
historical novel, instead of saying &ldquo;this is
very likely true,&rdquo; or &ldquo;what a wonderful work
of artistic reconstruction,&rdquo; we feel that we
were ourselves there; that we knew those
people; that they are a part of our very own
past. He paints a whole generation of people;
and in Pierre Bezukhov, the new landmarks
of his own search are described. Among
many other episodes, there is nowhere in
literature such a true and charming picture
of family life as that of the Rostovs, and nowhere
a more vital and charming personality
than Natasha; a creation as living as Pushkin&rsquo;s
Tatiana, and alive with a reality even
more convincing than Turgenev&rsquo;s pictures
of women, since she is alive with a different
kind of life; the difference being that while
you have read in Turgenev&rsquo;s books about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>204]</a></span>
noble and exquisite women, you are not
sure whether you have not known Natasha
yourself and in your own life; you are not
sure she does not belong to the borderland of
your own past in which dreams and reality
are mingled. <i>War and Peace</i> eclipses all
other historical novels; it has all Stendhal&rsquo;s
reality, and all Zola&rsquo;s power of dealing with
crowds and masses. Take, for instance, a
masterpiece such as Flaubert&rsquo;s <i>Salammb&ocirc;</i>;
it may and very likely does take away your
breath by the splendour of its language, its
colour, and its art, but you never feel that,
even in a dream, you had taken part in the
life which is painted there. The only bit of
unreality in <i>War and Peace</i> is the figure of
Napoleon, to whom Tolstoy was deliberately
unfair. Another impression which Tolstoy
gives us in <i>War and Peace</i> is that man is in
reality always the same, and that changes
of manners are not more important than
changes in fashions of clothes. That is why
it is not extravagant to mention <i>Salammb&ocirc;</i>
in this connection. One feels that, if Tolstoy
had written a novel about ancient Rome, we
should have known a score of patricians,
senators, scribblers, clients, parasites, matrons,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>205]</a></span>
courtesans, better even than we know Cicero
from his letters; we should not only feel that
we <i>know</i> Cicero, but that we had actually
known him. This very task&mdash;namely, that of
reconstituting a page out of Pagan history&mdash;was
later to be attempted by Merezhkovsky;
but brilliant as his work is, he only at times
and by flashes attains to Tolstoy&rsquo;s power of
convincing.</p>

<p><i>Anna Karenina</i> appeared in 1875-76. And
here Tolstoy, with the touch of a Velasquez and
upon a huge canvas, paints the contemporary
life of the upper classes in St. Petersburg and
in the country. Levin, the hero, is himself.
Here, again, the truth to nature and the reality
is so intense and vivid that a reader unacquainted
with Russia will in reading the book
probably not think of Russia at all, but will
imagine the story has taken place in his own
country, whatever that may be. He shows
you everything from the inside, as well as
from the outside. You feel, in the picture of
the races, what Anna is feeling in looking on,
and what Vronsky is feeling in riding. And
with what reality, what incomparable skill
the gradual dawn of Anna&rsquo;s love for Vronsky
is described; how painfully real is her pompous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>206]</a></span>
and excellent husband; and how every incident
in her love affair, her visit to her child, her
appearance at the opera, when, after having
left her husband, she defies the world, her
gradual growing irritability, down to the final
catastrophe, bears on it the stamp of something
which must have happened just in that
very way and no other.</p>

<p>But, as far as Tolstoy&rsquo;s own development
is concerned, Levin is the most interesting
figure in the book. This character is another
landmark in Tolstoy&rsquo;s search after truth; he
is constantly putting accepted ideas to the
test; he is haunted by the fear of sudden
death, not the physical fear of death in
itself, but the fear that in the face of death
the whole of life may be meaningless; a peasant
opens a new door for him and furnishes him
with a solution to the problem&mdash;to live for
one&rsquo;s soul: life no longer seems meaningless.</p>

<p>Thus Levin marks the stage in Tolstoy&rsquo;s
evolution of his abandoning materialism and
of seeking for the truth in the Church. But
the Church does not satisfy him. He rejects
its dogmas and its ritual; he turns to the
Gospel, but far from accepting it, he revises it.
He comes to the conclusion that Christianity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>207]</a></span>
as it has been taught is mere madness, and
that the Church is a superfluous anachronism.
Thus another change comes about, which is
generally regarded as <em>the</em> change cutting
Tolstoy&rsquo;s life in half; in reality it is only
a fresh right-about-turn of a man who is
searching for truth in blinkers. In his
<i>Confession</i>, he says: &ldquo;I grew to hate myself;
and now all has become clear.&rdquo; He came to
believe that property was the source of all
evil; he desired literally to give up all he had.
This he was not able to do. It was not that
he shrank from the sacrifice at the last; but
that circumstances and family ties were too
strong for him. But his final flight from home
in the last days of his life shows that the
desire had never left him.</p>

<p>Art was also subjected to his new standards
and found wanting, both in his own work and
in that of others. Shakespeare and Beethoven
were summarily disposed of; his own
masterpieces he pronounced to be worthless.
This more than anything shows the pride of
the man. He could admire no one, not even
himself. He scorned the gifts which were
given him, and the greatest gifts of the
greatest men. But this landmark of Tolstoy&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>208]</a></span>
evolution, his turning his back on the Church,
and on his work, is a landmark in Russian
history as well as in Russian art. For far
less than this Russian thinkers and writers
of high position had been imprisoned and
exiled. Nobody dared to touch Tolstoy. He
fearlessly attacked all constituted authority,
both spiritual and temporal, in an epoch of
reaction, and such was his prestige that
official Russia raised no finger. His authority
was too great, and this is perhaps the first
great victory of the liberty of individual
thought over official tyranny in Russia.
There had been martyrs in plenty before, but
no conquerors.</p>

<p>After <i>Anna Karenina</i>, Tolstoy, who gave
up literature for a time, but for a time only,
nevertheless continued to write; at first he only
wrote stories for children and theological and
polemical pamphlets; but in 1886 he published
the terribly powerful peasant drama:
<i>The Powers of Darkness</i>. Later came the
<i>Kreutzer Sonata</i>, the <i>Death of Ivan Ilitch</i>, and
<i>Resurrection</i>. Here the hero Nehludov is a
lifeless phantom of Tolstoy himself; the
episodes and details have the reality of
his early work, so has Maslova, the heroine;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>209]</a></span>
but in the squalor and misery of the prisons
he shows no precious balms of humanity and
love, as Dostoyevsky did; and the book has
neither the sweep and epic swing of <i>War and
Peace</i>, nor the satisfying completeness of
<i>Anna Karenina</i>. Since his death, some posthumous
works have been published, among
them a novel, and a play: <i>The Living Corpse</i>.
He died, as he had lived, still searching, and
perhaps at the end he found the object of his
quest.</p>

<p>Tolstoy, even more than Pushkin, was
rooted to the soil; all that is not of the soil&mdash;anything
mystic or supernatural&mdash;was totally
alien to him. He was the oak which could not
bend; and being, as he was, the king of realistic
fiction, an unsurpassed painter of pictures,
portraits, men and things, a penetrating analyst
of the human heart, a genius cast in a colossal
mould, his work, both by its substance and
its artistic power, exercised an influence beyond
his own country, affected all European
nations, and gives him a place among the great
creators of the world. Tolstoy was not a rebel
but a heretic, a heretic not only to religion and
the Church, but in philosophy, opinions, art,
and even in food; but what the world will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>210]</a></span>
remember of him are not his heretical theories
but his faithful practice, which is orthodox in
its obedience to the highest canons, orthodox
as Homer and Shakespeare are orthodox, and
like theirs, one of the greatest earthly examples
of the normal and the sane.</p>

<p>To say that <span class="smcap">Dostoyevsky</span> is the antithesis
to Tolstoy, and the second great pillar of
Russian prose literature, will surprise nobody
now. Had one been writing ten years ago,
the expression of such an opinion would have
met with an incredulous smile amongst the
majority of English readers of Russian literature,
for Dostoyevsky was practically unknown
save for his <i>Crime and Punishment</i>,
and to have compared him with Turgenev
would have seemed sacrilegious. Now when
Dostoyevsky is one of the shibboleths of our
<i>intelligentsia</i>, one can boldly say, without fear
of being misunderstood, that, as a creator
and a force in literature, Dostoyevsky is in
another plane than that of Turgenev, and as
far greater than him as Leonardo da Vinci
is greater than Vandyke, or as Wagner is
greater than Gounod, while some Russians
consider him even infinitely greater than
Tolstoy. Let us say he is his equal and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>211]</a></span>
complement. He is in any case, in almost
every respect, his antithesis. Tolstoy was the
incarnation of health, and is above all things
and pre-eminently the painter of the sane and
the earthly. Dostoyevsky was an epileptic, the
painter of the abnormal, of criminals, madmen,
degenerates, mystics. Tolstoy led an even,
uneventful life, spending the greater part of
it in his own country house, in the midst of
a large family. Dostoyevsky was condemned
to death, served a sentence of four years&rsquo;
hard labour in a convict settlement in
Siberia, and besides this spent six years in
exile; when he returned and started a newspaper,
it was prohibited by the Censorship;
a second newspaper which he started came to
grief; he underwent financial ruin; his first
wife, his brother, and his best friend died;
he was driven abroad by debt, harassed by the
authorities on the one hand, and attacked by
the liberals on the other; abused and misunderstood,
almost starving and never well, working
under overwhelming difficulties, always
pressed for time, and ill requited for his
toil. That was Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s life.</p>

<p>Tolstoy was a heretic; at first a materialist,
and then a seeker after a religion of his own;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>212]</a></span>
Dostoyevsky was a practising believer, a
vehement apostle of orthodoxy, and died
fortified by the Sacraments of the Church.
Tolstoy with his broad unreligious opinions
was narrow-minded. Dostoyevsky with his
definite religious opinions was the most
broad-minded man who ever lived. Tolstoy
hated the supernatural, and was alien to all
mysticism. Dostoyevsky seems to get nearer
to the unknown, to what lies beyond the
flesh, than any other writer. In Tolstoy, the
Peter the Great element of the Russian
character predominated; in Dostoyevsky that
of Mwyshkin, the pure fool. Tolstoy could
never submit and humble himself. Submission
and humility and resignation are the keynotes
and mainsprings of Dostoyevsky. Tolstoy
despised art, and paid no homage to any of
the great names of literature; and this was
not only after the so-called change. As early
as 1862, he said that Pushkin and Beethoven
could not please because of their absolute
beauty. Dostoyevsky was catholic and cosmopolitan,
and admired the literature of
foreign countries&mdash;Racine as well as Shakespeare,
Corneille as well as Schiller. The
essence of Tolstoy is a magnificent intolerance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>213]</a></span>
The essence of Dostoyevsky is sweet reasonableness.
Tolstoy dreamed of giving up all he
had to the poor, and of living like a peasant;
Dostoyevsky had to share the hard labour
of the lowest class of criminals. Tolstoy
theorized on the distribution of food; but
Dostoyevsky was fed like a beggar. Tolstoy
wrote in affluence and at leisure, and re-wrote
his books; Dostoyevsky worked like a literary
hack for his daily bread, ever pressed for time
and ever in crying need of money.</p>

<p>These contrasts are not made in disparagement
of Tolstoy, but merely to point out the
difference between the two men and between
their circumstances. Tolstoy wrote about
himself from the beginning of his career to the
end; nearly all his work is autobiographical,
and he almost always depicts himself in all
his books. We know nothing of Dostoyevsky
from his books. He was an altruist, and
he loved others better than himself.</p>

<p>Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s first book, <i>Poor Folk</i>, published
in 1846, is a descendant of Gogol&rsquo;s
story <i>The Cloak</i>, and bears the influence, to
a slight extent, of Gogol. In this, the story
of a minor public servant battling against
want, and finding a ray of light in corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>214]</a></span>
with a girl also in poor circumstances, but
who ultimately marries a rich middle-aged
man, we already get all Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s peculiar
sweetness; what Stevenson called his &ldquo;lovely
goodness,&rdquo; his almost intolerable pathos, his
love of the disinherited and of the failures
of life. His next book, <i>Letters from a Dead
House</i>, has a far more universal interest. It
is the record of his prison experiences, which
is of priceless value, not only on account of
its radiant moral beauty, its perpetual discovery
of the soul of goodness in things evil,
its human fraternity, its complete absence
of egotism and pose, and its thrilling human
interest, but also on account of the light it
throws on the Russian character, the Russian
poor, and the Russian peasant.</p>

<p>In 1866 came <i>Crime and Punishment</i>,
which brought Dostoyevsky fame. This book,
Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s <i>Macbeth</i>, is so well known in
the French and English translations that it
hardly needs any comment. Dostoyevsky
never wrote anything more tremendous than
the portrayal of the anguish that seethes in the
soul of Raskolnikov, after he has killed the old
woman, &ldquo;mechanically forced,&rdquo; as Professor
Br&uuml;ckner says, &ldquo;into performing the act, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>215]</a></span>
if he had gone too near machinery in motion,
had been caught by a bit of his clothing and
cut to pieces.&rdquo; And not only is one held
spellbound by every shifting hope, fear, and
doubt, and each new pang that Raskolnikov
experiences, but the souls of all the subsidiary
characters in the book are revealed to us just
as clearly: the Marmeladov family, the honest
Razumikhin, the police inspector, and the
atmosphere of the submerged tenth in St.
Petersburg&mdash;the steaming smell of the city
in the summer. There is an episode when
Raskolnikov kneels before Sonia, the prostitute,
and says to her: &ldquo;It is not before you
I am kneeling, but before all the suffering of
mankind.&rdquo; That is what Dostoyevsky does
himself in this and in all his books; but in
none of them is the suffering of all mankind
conjured up before us in more living colours,
and in none of them is his act of homage in
kneeling before it more impressive.</p>

<p>This book was written before the words
&ldquo;psychological novel&rdquo; had been invented;
but how all the psychological novels which
were written years later by Bourget and
others pale before this record written in blood
and tears! <i>Crime and Punishment</i> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>216]</a></span>
followed by <i>The Idiot</i> (1868). The idiot is
Mwyshkin, who has been alluded to already,
the wise fool, an epileptic, in whom irony
and arrogance and egoism have been annihilated;
and whose very simplicity causes him
to pass unscathed through a den of evil, a
world of liars, scoundrels, and thieves, none
of whom can escape the influence of his
radiant personality. He is the same with
every one he meets, and with his unsuspicious
sincerity he combines the intuition of utter
goodness, so that he can see through people
and read their minds. In this character,
Dostoyevsky has put all his sweetness; it is
not a portrait of himself, but it is a portrait
of what he would have liked to be, and
reflects all that is best in him. In contrast
to Mwyshkin, Rogozhin, the merchant, is the
incarnation of undisciplined passion, who
ends by killing the thing he loves, Nastasia,
also a creature of unbridled impulses,&mdash;because
he feels that he can never really and fully
possess her. The catastrophe, the description
of the night after Rogozhin has killed Nastasia,
is like nothing else in literature; lifelike in
detail and immense, in the way in which it
makes you listen at the keyhole of the soul,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>217]</a></span>
immense with the immensity of a great revelation.
The minor characters in the book are
also all of them remarkable; one of them,
the General&rsquo;s wife, Madame Epanchin, has an
indescribable and playful charm.</p>

<p><i>The Idiot</i> was followed by <i>The Possessed</i>,
or <i>Devils</i>, printed in 1871-72, called thus after
the Devils in the Gospel of St. Luke, that
left the possessed man and went into the
swine; the Devils in the book are the hangers-on
of Nihilism between 1862 and 1869. The
book anticipated the future, and in it
Dostoyevsky created characters who were
identically the same, and committed identically
the same crimes, as men who actually
lived many years later in 1871, and later
still. The whole book turns on the exploitation
by an unscrupulous, ingenious, and iron-willed
knave of the various weaknesses of a
crowd of idealist dupes and disciples. One of
them is a decadent, one of them is one of those
idealists &ldquo;whom any strong idea strikes all of
a sudden and annihilates his will, sometimes for
ever&rdquo;; one of them is a maniac whose single
idea is the production of the Superman which
he thinks will come, when it will be immaterial
to a man whether he lives or dies, and when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>218]</a></span>
he will be prepared to kill himself not out of
fear but in order to kill fear. That man will be
God. Not the God-man, but the Man-God.
The plan of the unscrupulous leader, Peter
Verkhovensky, who was founded on Nechaev, a
Nihilist of real life, is to create disorder, and
amid the disorder to seize the authority; he
imagines a central committee of which he
pretends to be the representative, organizes
a small local committee, and persuades his
dupes that a network of similar small committees
exist all over Russia; his aim being
to create them gradually, by persuading people
in every plot of fresh ground that they exist
everywhere else.</p>

<p>Thus the idea of the book was to show that
the strength of Nihilism lay, not in high
dogmas and theories held by a large and well-organized
society, but in the strength of the
will of one or two men reacting on the weaker
herd and exploiting the strength, the weakness,
and the one-sidedness of its ideals, a
herd which was necessarily weak owing to
that very one-sidedness. In order to bind his
disciples with a permanent bond, Verkhovensky
exploits the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">id&eacute;e fixe</i> of suicide and the
superman, which is held by one of his dupes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>219]</a></span>
to induce him to commit a crime before he
kills himself, and thus make away with another
member of the committee who is represented
as being a spy. Once this is done, the whole
committee will be jointly responsible, and
bound to him by the ties of blood and fear.
But Verkhovensky is not the hero of the book.
The hero is Stavrogin, whom Verkhovensky
regards as his trump card, because of the
strength of his character, which leads him to
commit the most outrageous extravagances,
and at the same time to remain as cold as
ice; but Verkhovensky&rsquo;s whole design is shattered
on Stavrogin&rsquo;s character, all the murders
already mentioned are committed, the whole
scheme comes to nothing, the conspirators are
discovered, and Peter escapes abroad.</p>

<p>When <i>Devils</i> appeared in 1871, it was looked
upon as a gross exaggeration, but real life in
subsequent years was to produce characters
and events of the same kind, which were more
startling than Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s fiction. The
book is the least well-constructed of Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s;
the narrative is disconnected, and the
events, incidents, and characters so crowded
together, that the general effect is confused;
on the other hand, it contains isolated scenes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>220]</a></span>
which Dostoyevsky never surpassed; and in
its strength and in its limitations it is perhaps
his most characteristic work.</p>

<p>From 1873-80 Dostoyevsky went back to
journalism, and wrote his <i>Diary of a Writer</i>,
in which he commented on current events.
In 1880, he united all conflicting and hostile
parties and shades of public opinion, by the
speech he made at the unveiling of Pushkin&rsquo;s
memorial, in one common bond of enthusiasm.
At the end of the seventies, he returned
to a work already begun, <i>The Brothers
Karamazov</i>, which, although it remains the
longest of his books, was never finished. It
is the story of three brothers, Dimitri, Ivan,
and Alyosha; their father is a cynical sensualist.
The eldest brother is an undisciplined,
passionate character, who expiates his
passions by suffering; the second brother is
a materialist, the tragedy of whose inner life
forms a greater part of the book; the third
brother, Alyosha, is a lover of humanity, and
a believer in God and man. He seeks a
monastery, but his spiritual father sends him
out into the world, to live and to suffer. He
is to go through the furnace of the world and
experience many trials; for the microbe of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>221]</a></span>
lust that is in his family is dormant in him
also. The book was called the <i>History of a
Great Sinner</i>, and the sinner was to be Alyosha.
But Dostoyevsky died before this part of the
subject is even approached.</p>

<p>He died in January 1881; the crowds of
men and women of all sorts and conditions of
life that attended his funeral, and the extent
and the sincerity of the grief manifested,
gave it an almost mythical greatness. The
people gave him a funeral such as few kings
or heroes have ever had. Without fear of
controversy or contradiction one can now say
that Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s place in Russian literature
is at the top, equal and in the opinion of some
superior to that of Tolstoy in greatness. He
is also one of the greatest writers the world has
ever produced, not because, like Tolstoy, he
saw life steadily and saw it whole, and painted
it with the supreme and easy art of a Velasquez;
nor because, like Turgenev, he wove exquisite
pictures into musical words. Dostoyevsky
was not an artist; his work is shapeless; his
books are like quarries where granite and
dross, gold and ore are mingled. He paid no
attention to style, and yet so strong and vital
is his spoken word that when the Moscow Art
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>222]</a></span>
Theatre put some scenes in <i>The Brothers
Karamazov</i> and <i>Devils</i> on the stage, they
found they could not alter one single syllable;
and sometimes his words have a power beyond
that of words, a power that only music has.
There are pages where Dostoyevsky expresses
the anguish of the soul in the same manner
as Wagner expressed the delirium of dying
Tristram. I should indeed put the matter the
other way round, and say that in the last act
of Tristram, Wagner is as great as Dostoyevsky.
But Dostoyevsky is great because of
the divine message he gives, not didactically,
not by sermons, but by the goodness that
emanates, like a precious balm, from the
characters he creates; because more than any
other books in the world his books reflect not
only the teaching and the charity, but the
accent and the divine aura of love that is in
the Gospels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not talking to you now through the
medium of custom, conventionalities, or even
of mortal flesh; it is my spirit that addresses
your spirit, just as if both had passed through
the grave, and we stood at God&rsquo;s feet, equal&mdash;as
we are!&rdquo; These words, spoken by
Charlotte Bront&euml;&rsquo;s <i>Jane Eyre</i>, express what
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>223]</a></span>
Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s books do. His spirit addresses
our spirit. &ldquo;Be no man&rsquo;s judge; humble
love is a terrible power which effects more
than violence. Only active love can bring
out faith. Love men, and do not be afraid
of their sins; love man in his sin; love all
the creatures of God, and pray God to make
you cheerful. Be cheerful as children and
as the birds.&rdquo; This was Father Zosima&rsquo;s
advice to Alyosha. And that is the gist of
Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s message to mankind. &ldquo;Life,&rdquo;
Father Zosima also says to Alyosha, &ldquo;will
bring you many misfortunes, but you will be
happy on account of them, and you will bless
life and cause others to bless it.&rdquo; Here we
have the whole secret of Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s greatness.
He blessed life, and he caused others
to bless it.</p>

<p>It is objected that his characters are
abnormal; that he deals with the diseased,
with epileptics, neurasthenics, criminals, sensualists,
madmen; but it is just this very fact
which gives so much strength and value to
the blessing he gave to life; it is owing to
this fact that he causes others to bless life;
because he was cast in the nethermost circle
of life&rsquo;s inferno; he was thrown together with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>224]</a></span>
the refuse of humanity, with the worst of men
and with the most unfortunate; he saw the
human soul on the rack, and he saw the vilest
diseases that afflict the human soul; he faced
the evil without fear or blinkers; and there,
in the inferno, in the dust and ashes, he
recognized the print of divine footsteps and
the fragrance of goodness; he cried from the
abyss: &ldquo;Hosanna to the Lord, for He is just!&rdquo;
and he blessed life. It is true that his characters
are taken almost entirely from the
<i>Despised and Rejected</i>, as one of his books
was called, and often from the ranks of the
abnormal; but when a great writer wishes to
reveal the greatest adventures and the deepest
experiences which the soul of man can undergo,
it is in vain for him to take the normal type;
it has no adventures. The adventures of the
soul of Fortinbras would be of no help to mankind;
but the adventures of Hamlet are of
help to mankind, and the adventures of Don
Quixote; and neither Don Quixote nor Hamlet
are normal types.</p>

<p>Dostoyevsky wrote the tragedy of life and
of the soul, and to do this he chose circumstances
as terrific as those which unhinged
the reason of King Lear, shook that of Hamlet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>225]</a></span>
and made &OElig;dipus blind himself. His books
resemble Greek tragedies by the magnitude
of the spiritual adventures they set forth;
they are unlike Greek Tragedies in the
Christian charity and the faith and the hope
which goes out of them; they inspire the
reader with courage, never with despair,
although Dostoyevsky, face to face with the
last extremities of evil, never seeks to hide it
or to shun it, but merely to search for the
soul of goodness in it. He did not search in
vain, and just as, when he was on his way to
Siberia, a conversation he had with a fellow-prisoner
inspired that fellow-prisoner with the
feeling that he could go on living and even
face penal servitude, so do Dostoyevsky&rsquo;s
books come to mankind as a message of hope
from a radiant country. That is what constitutes
his peculiar greatness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<br />
<small>THE SECOND AGE OF POETRY</small></h2>


<p>The fifties, the sixties, and the seventies
were, all over Europe, the epoch of Parnassian
poetry. In England, Tennyson was pouring
out his &ldquo;fervent and faultless melodies,&rdquo;
Matthew Arnold was playing his plaintive
harp, and the Pre-Raphaelites were weaving
their tapestried dreams; in France, Gautier
was carving his cameos, Banville&rsquo;s Harlequins
and Columbines were dancing on a
Watteau-like stage in the silver twilight of
Corot, Baudelaire was at work on his sombre
bronze, Sully-Prudhomme twanged his ivory
lyre, and Leconte de Lisle was issuing his
golden coinage. It was, in poetry, the epoch
of art for art&rsquo;s sake.</p>

<p>Russian poetry did not escape the universal
tendency; but in Russia everything was conspiring
to put poetry, and especially that kind
of poetry, in the shade. In the first place,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>227]</a></span>
events of great magnitude were happening&mdash;the
wide reforms, the emancipation of the
serfs, the growth of Nihilism, which was the
product of the disillusion at the result of the
reforms: in the second place, criticism under
the influence of Chernyshevsky, Pisarev, and
Dobrolyubov was entirely realistic and positivist,
preaching not art for life&rsquo;s sake only,
but the absolute futility of poetry; and, in
the third place, work of the supremest kind
was being done in narrative fiction; in the
fourth place, no prophet-poet was forthcoming
whose genius was great enough to
voice national aspirations. All this tended
to put poetry in the shade, especially as such
poets as did exist were, with one notable
exception, Parnassians, whose talent dwelt
aloof from the turbid stream of life, and who
sought to express the adventures of their
souls, which were emotional and artistic, either
in dreamy music or in exquisite shapes and
colours. This neglect of verse lasted right
up until the end of the seventies. When, however,
in the eighties, the wave of political crisis
reached its climax and, after the assassination
of Alexander II, rolled back into a sea
of stagnant reaction, the poets, who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>228]</a></span>
hitherto neglected, and quietly singing all the
while, were discovered once more, and the
shares in poetry continued to rise as time
went on; thus the poets of the sixties reaped
their due meed of appreciation.</p>

<p>A proof of how widespread and deep this
neglect was is that <span class="smcap">Tyutchev</span>, whose work
attracted no attention whatever until 1854,
and met with no wide appreciation until a
great deal later, was four years younger than
Pushkin, and a man of thirty when Goethe
died. He went on living until 1873, and can
be called the first of the Parnassians. Politically,
he was a Slavophile, and sang the
&ldquo;resignation&rdquo; and &ldquo;long-suffering&rdquo; of the
Russian people, which he preferred to the
stiff-neckedness of the West. But the value
of his work lies less in his Slavophile aspirations
than in its depth of thought and lyrical
feeling, in the contrast between the gloomy
forebodings of his imagination and the sunlike
images he gives of nature. His verse is
like a spring day, dark with ominous thunderclouds,
out of which a rainbow and a shaft
of sunlight fall on a dewy orchard and light
it with a silvery smile. His verse is, on the
one hand, full of foreboding and terror at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>229]</a></span>
fate of man and the shadow of nothingness,
and, on the other hand, it twitters like a bird
over the freshness and sunshine of spring.
He sings the spring again and again, and no
Russian poet has ever sung the glory, the
mystery, the wonder, and the terror of night
as he has done; his whole work is compounded
of glowing pictures of nature and a
world of longing and of unutterable dreams.</p>

<p>The dreamy dominion of the Parnassian
age, on whose threshold Tyutchev stood, was
to be disturbed by the notes of a harsher and
stronger music.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nekrasov</span> (1821-77), Russia&rsquo;s &ldquo;sternest
painter,&rdquo; and certainly one of her best, drew
his inspiration direct from life, and sang the
sufferings, the joys, and the life of the people.
He is a Russian Crabbe; nature and man are
his subjects, but nature as the friend and foe
of man, as a factor, the most important factor
in man&rsquo;s life, and not as an ideal storehouse
from which a Shelley can draw forms more
real than living man, nurslings of immortality,
or a Wordsworth reap harvests of the inward
eye. He called his muse the &ldquo;Muse of
Vengeance and of Grief.&rdquo; He is an uncompromising
realist, like Crabbe, and idealizes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>230]</a></span>
nothing in his pictures of the peasant&rsquo;s life.
Like Crabbe, he has a deep note of pathos,
and a keen but not so minute an eye for
landscape.</p>

<p>On the other hand, he at times attains to
imaginative sublimity in his descriptions, as,
for instance, in his poem called <i>The Red-nosed
Frost</i>, where King Frost approaches a peasant
widow who is at work in the winter forest,
and freezes her to death. As Daria is gradually
freezing to death, the frost comes to her
like a warrior; and his semblance and attributes
are drawn in a series of splendid stanzas.
He sings to her of his riches that no profusion
can decrease, and of his kingdom of silver and
diamonds and pearls: then, as she freezes, she
dreams of a hot summer&rsquo;s day, and of the rye
harvest and of the familiar songs&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Away with the song she is soaring,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She surrenders herself to its stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world there is no such sweet singing<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As that which we hear in a dream.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>His longest and most ambitious work was
a kind of popular epic, <i>Who is Happy in
Russia?</i> written in short lines which have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>231]</a></span>
the popular ring and accent. Some peasants
start on a pilgrimage to find out who is happy
in Russia. They fly on a magic carpet, and
interview representatives of the different
classes of society, the pope, the landowner,
the peasant woman, each new interview
producing a whole series of stories, sometimes
idyllic and sometimes tragic, and all
showing their genius as intimate pictures of
various phases of Russian life. Here, again,
the analogy with Crabbe suggests itself, for
Nekrasov&rsquo;s tales, taking into consideration the
difference between the two countries, have a
marked affinity, both in their subject matter,
their variety, their stern realism, their pathos,
their bitterness, and their observation of
nature, with Crabbe&rsquo;s stories in verse.</p>

<p>Two of Nekrasov&rsquo;s long poems tell the story
in the form of reminiscence,&mdash;and here again
the naturalness and appropriateness of the
diction is perfect,&mdash;of the Russian women,
Princess Volkonsky and Princess Trubetzkoy,
who followed their husbands, condemned to
penal servitude for taking part in the Decembrist
rising, to Siberia. Here, again, Nekrasov
strikes a note of deep and poignant pathos,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>232]</a></span>
all the more poignant from the absolute
simplicity with which the tales are told.
Nekrasov towers among the Parnassians of
the time and has only one rival, whom we
shall describe presently.</p>

<p>The Parnassians are represented by three
poets, <span class="smcap">Maikov</span> (1821-97), <span class="smcap">Fet</span> (1820-98),
and <span class="smcap">Polonsky</span> (1820-98), all three of whom
began to write about the same time, in 1840;
none of these three poets was didactic, and
all three remained aloof from political or
social questions.</p>

<p>Maikov is attracted by classical themes, by
Italy and also by old ballads, but his strength
lies in his plastic form, his colour, and his
pictures of Russian landscape; he writes, for
instance, an exquisite reminiscence of a day&rsquo;s
fishing when he was a boy.</p>

<p>The quality of Fet&rsquo;s muse, in contrast to
Maikov&rsquo;s concrete plasticity, is illusiveness;
his lyrics express intangible dreams and impressions;
delicate tints and shadows tremble
and flit across his verse, which is soft as the
orient of a pearl; and his fancy is as delicate as
a thread of gossamer: he lives in the borderland
between words and music, and catches
the vague echoes of that limbo.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The world in shadow slipped away<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, like a silent dream took flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Adam, I in Eden lay<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Alone, and face to face with night.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>He sings about the southern night amidst
the hay; or again about the dawn&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;A whisper, a breath, a shiver,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The trills of the nightingale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silver light and a quiver<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And a sunlit trail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glimmer of night and the shadows of night<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In an endless race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enchanted changes, flight after flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">On the loved one&rsquo;s face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood of the roses tingling<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In the clouds, and a gleam in the grey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tears and kisses commingling&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Dawn, the Dawn, the Day!&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>Polonsky&rsquo;s verse, in contrast to Fet&rsquo;s gentle
epicurean temperament, his delicate half-tones
and illusive whispers, is made of sterner
stuff; and, in contrast to Maikov&rsquo;s sculptural
lines, it is pre-eminently musical, and reflects
a fine and charming personality. His area
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>234]</a></span>
of subjects is wide; he can write a child&rsquo;s poem
as transparent and simple as Hans Andersen&mdash;as
in his conversation between the sun and
the moon&mdash;or call up the &ldquo;glory that was
Greece,&rdquo; as in the poem when his &ldquo;Aspasia&rdquo;
listens to the crowds acclaiming Pericles, and
waits in rapturous suspense for his return&mdash;an
evocation that Browning would have
envied for its life and Swinburne for its
sound.</p>

<p>But neither Maikov, Fet, nor Polonsky,
exquisite as much of their writing is, produced
anything of the calibre of Nekrasov, even in
their own province; that is to say, they were
none of them as great in the artistic field as
he was in his didactic field. Compared with
him, they are minor poets. There is one
poet of this epoch who does rival Nekrasov
in another field, and that is <span class="smcap">Count Alexis
Tolstoy</span> (1817-75), who was also a Parnassian
and remained aloof from didactic
literature; yet, under the pseudonym of
Kuzma Prutkov, he wrote a satire, a collection
of platitudes, that are household words in
Russia; also a short history of Russia in
consummately neat and witty satirical verse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>235]</a></span>
As well as his satires, he wrote an historical
novel, <i>Prince Serebryany</i>, and more important
still, a trilogy of plays, dealing with the most
dramatic epoch of Russian history, that of
Ivan the Terrible. The trilogy, written in
verse, consists of the &ldquo;Death of Ivan the
Terrible,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Tsar Feodor Ivanovitch&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Tsar Boris.&rdquo; They are all of them
acting plays, form part of the current classical
repertory, and are effective, impressive and
arresting when played on the stage.</p>

<p>But it is as a poet and as a lyrical poet that
Alexis Tolstoy is most widely known. Versatile
with a versatility that recalls Pushkin,
he writes epical ballads on Russian, Northern,
and even Scottish themes, and dramatic
poems on Don Juan, St. John Damascene,
and Mary Magdalene; and, besides these, a
whole series of personal lyrics, which are full
of charm, tenderness, music and colour,
harmonious in form and transparent. No
Russian poet since Pushkin has written such
tender love lyrics, and nobody has sung the
Russian spring, the Russian summer, and
the Russian autumn with such tender
lyricism. His poem on the early spring,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>236]</a></span>
when the fern is still tightly curled, the shepherd&rsquo;s
note still but half heard in the morning,
and the birch trees just green, is one of the
most tender, fresh, and perfect expressions
of first love, morning, spring, dew, and dawn
in the world&rsquo;s literature. His songs have
inspired Tchaikovsky and other composers.
The strongest and highest chord he struck is
in his St. John Damascene; this contains
a magnificent dirge for the dead which can
bear comparison even with the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dies Ir&aelig;</i>
for majesty, solemn pathos, and plangent
rhythm.</p>

<p>His pictures of landscapes have a peculiar
charm. The following is an attempt at a
translation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Through the slush and the ruts of the highway,<br /></span>

</div>
</div>

<p>The people also produced a poet during
this epoch and gave Koltsov a successor, in
the person of <span class="smcap">Nikitin</span>; his themes are taken
straight from life, and he became known
through his patriotic songs written during the
Crimean War; but he is most successful in
his descriptions of nature, of sunset on the
fields, and dawn, and the swallow&rsquo;s nest in
the grumbling mill. Two other poets, whose
work became well known later, but passed
absolutely unnoticed in the sixties, were
<span class="smcap">Sluchevsky</span>, a philosophical poet, whose
verse, excellent in description, suffers from
clumsiness in form, and <span class="smcap">Apukhtin</span>, whose
collected poems and ballads, although he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>239]</a></span>
began to write in 1859, were not published
until 1886. Apukhtin is a Parnassian. The
bulk of his work, though perfect in form, is
uninteresting; but he wrote one or two lyrics
which have a place in any Russian Golden
Treasury, and his poems are largely read
now.</p>

<p>In the eighties, a reaction against the anti-poetical
tendency set in, and poets began to
spring up like mushrooms. Of these, the
most popular and the most remarkable is
<span class="smcap">Nadson</span> (1862-87); he died when he was
twenty-four, of consumption. Since then his
verse has gone through twenty-one editions,
and 110,000 copies have been sold; ten editions
were published in his own lifetime. And
there are innumerable musical settings by
various composers to his lyrics. His verse
inaugurates a new epoch in Russian poetry,
the distinguishing features of which are a
great attention to form and <em>technique</em>, a
Parnassian love of colour and shape, and a
deep melancholy.</p>

<p>Nadson sings the melancholy of youth, the
dreams and disillusions of adolescence, and
the hopelessness of the stagnant atmosphere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>240]</a></span>
of reaction to which he belonged. This last
fact accounted in some measure for his
extraordinary popularity. But it was by no
means its sole cause; his verse is not only
exquisite but magically musical, to an extent
which makes the verse of other poets seem
a stuff of coarser clay, and his pictures of
nature, of spring, of night, and especially of
night in the Riviera (with a note of passionate
home-sickness), have the aromatic,
intoxicating sweetness of syringa. Verse such
as this, sensitive, ultra-delicate, morbid,
nervous, and pessimistic, is bound to have
the defects of its qualities, in a marked degree;
one is soon inclined to have enough
of its sultry, oppressive atmosphere, its delicate
perfume, its unrelieved gloom and its
music, which is nearly always not only in
a minor key but in the same key. Nobody
was more keenly aware of this than Nadson
himself, and one of his most beautiful poems
begins thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Dear friend, I know, I know, I only know too well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That my verse is barren of all strength, and pale, and delicate,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>241]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And often just because of its debility I suffer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often weep in secret in the silence of the night.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And in another poem he writes his apology.
He has never used verse as a toy to chase
tedium; the blessed gift of the singer has
often been to him an unbearable cross, and
he has often vowed to keep silent; but, if
the wind blows, the &AElig;olian harp must needs
respond, and streams of the hills cannot help
rushing to the valley if the sun melts the snow
on the mountain tops. This apologia more
than all criticism defines his gift. His temperament
is an &AElig;olian harp, which, whether
it will or no, is sensitive to the breeze; its
strings are few, and tuned to one key; nevertheless
some of the strains it has sobbed have
the stamp of permanence as well as that of
ethereal magic.</p>

<p>The poets that come after Nadson belong
to the present day; there are many, and
they increase in number every year. The so-called
&ldquo;decadent&rdquo; school were influenced by
Shelley, Verlaine, and the French symbolists;
but there is nothing which is decadent in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>242]</a></span>
ordinary sense of the word in their verse.
Their influence may not be lasting, but they
are factors in Russian literature, and some
of them, <span class="smcap">Sologub</span>, <span class="smcap">Brusov</span>, <span class="smcap">Balmont</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Ivanov</span>, have produced work which any school
would be glad to claim. This is also true of
<span class="smcap">Alexander Bloch</span>, one of the most original
as well as one of the most exquisite of living
Russian poets.</p>

<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>


<p>With the death of Turgenev and Dostoyevsky,
the great epoch of Russian literature
came to an end. A period of literary as well
as of political stagnation began, which lasted
until the Russo-Japanese War. This was
followed by the revolutionary movement,
which, in its turn, produced a literary as well
as a political chaos, the effect of which and
of the manifold reactions it brought about are
still being felt. It was only natural, if one
considers the extent and the quality of the
productions of the preceding epoch, that the
soil of literary Russia should require a rest.</p>

<p>As it is, one can count the writers of
prominence which the epoch of stagnation
produced on one&rsquo;s fingers&mdash;<span class="smcap">Chekhov</span>, <span class="smcap">Garshin</span>,
<span class="smcap">Korolenko</span>, and at the end of the period
<span class="smcap">Maxime Gorky</span>, and apart from them, in a
by-path of his own, <span class="smcap">Merezhkovsky</span>. Of
these Chekhov and Gorky tower above the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>244]</a></span>
others. Chekhov enlarged the range of Russian
literature by painting the middle-class
and the <i>Intelligentsia</i>, and brought back to
Russian literature the note of humour; and
Gorky broke altogether fresh ground by painting
the vagabond, the artisan, the tramp, the
thief, the flotsam and jetsam of the big town
and the highway, and by painting in a new
manner.</p>

<p>Gorky&rsquo;s work came like that of Mr. Rudyard
Kipling to England, as a revelation. Not
only did his subject matter open the doors
on dominions undreamed of, but his attitude
towards life and that of his heroes towards life
seemed to be different from that of all Russian
novelists before his advent; and yet the difference
between him and his forerunners is not
so great as it appears at first sight. It is
true that his rough and rebellious heroes, instead
of playing the Hamlet, or of finding the
solution of life in charity and humility or submission,
are partisans of the survival of the
fittest with a vengeance, the survival of the
strongest fist and the sharpest knife; yet are
these new heroes really so different from the
uncompromising type that we have already
seen sharing one half of the Russian stage,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>245]</a></span>
right through the story of Russian literature,
from Bazarov back to Peter the Great, and
on whose existence was founded the remark
that Peter the Great was one of the ingredients
in the Russian character? Put Bazarov on the
road, or Lermontov, or even Peter the Great,
and you get Gorky&rsquo;s barefooted hero.</p>

<p>Where Gorky created something absolutely
new was in the surroundings and in the manner
of life which he described, and in the way
he described them; this is especially true of
his treatment of nature: for the first time in
Russian prose literature, we get away from
the &ldquo;orthodox&rdquo; landscape of convention,
and we are face to face with the elements.
We feel as if a new breath of air had entered
into literature; we feel as people accustomed
to the manner in which the poets treated
nature in England in the eighteenth century
must have felt when Wordsworth, Byron,
Shelley and Coleridge began to write.</p>

<p>Chekhov worked on older lines. He descends
directly from Turgenev, although his
field is a different one. He, more than any
other writer and better than any other writer,
painted the epoch of stagnation, when Russia,
as a Russian once said, was playing itself to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>246]</a></span>
death at <i>vindt</i> (an older form of <em>Bridge</em>).
The tone of his work is grey, and indeed
resembles, as Tolstoy said, that of a photographer,
by its objective realism as well as by
its absence of high tones; yet if Chekhov is a
photographer, he is at the same time a supreme
artist, an artist in black and white, and his
pessimism is counteracted by two other factors,
his sense of humour and his humanity;
were it not so, the impression of sadness one
would derive from the sum of misery which
his crowded stage of merchants, students,
squires, innkeepers, waiters, schoolmasters,
magistrates, popes, officials, make up between
them, would be intolerable. Some of Chekhov&rsquo;s
most interesting work was written for
the stage, on which he also brought Scenes of
Country Life, which is the sub-title of the play
<i>Uncle Vanya</i>. There are the same grey tints,
the same weary, amiable, and slack people,
bankrupt of ideals and poor in hope, whom we
meet in the stories; and here, too, behind
the sordid triviality and futility, we hear
the &ldquo;still sad music of humanity.&rdquo; But
in order that the tints of Chekhov&rsquo;s delicate
living and breathing photographs can be effective
on the stage, very special acting is necessary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>247]</a></span>
in order to convey the quality of atmosphere
which is his special gift. Fortunately
he met with exactly the right technique and
the appropriate treatment at the Art Theatre
at Moscow.</p>

<p>Chekhov died in 1904, soon after the Russo-Japanese
War had begun. Apart from the
main stream and tradition of Russian fiction
and Russian prose, Merezhkovsky occupies a
unique place, a place which lies between
criticism and imaginative historical fiction,
not unlike, in some respects&mdash;but very different
in others&mdash;that which is occupied by Walter
Pater in English fiction. His best known
work, at least his best known work in Europe,
is a prose trilogy, &ldquo;The Death of the Gods&rdquo;
(a study of Julian the apostate), &ldquo;The
Resurrection of the Gods&rdquo; (the story of
Leonardo da Vinci), and &ldquo;The Antichrist&rdquo; (the
story of Peter the Great and his son Alexis),
which has been translated into nearly every
European language. This trilogy is an essay
in imaginative historical reconstitution; it
testifies to a real and deep culture, and it is
lit at times by flashes of imaginative inspiration
which make the scenes of the past live;
it is alive with suggestive thought; but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>248]</a></span>
not throughout convincing, there is a touch
of Bulwer Lytton as well as a touch of Goethe
and Pater in it. Merezhkovsky is perhaps more
successful in his purely critical work, his books
on Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Gogol, which
are infinitely stimulating, suggestive, and
original, than in his historical fiction, although,
needless to say, his criticism appeals to a far
narrower public. He is in any case one of
the most brilliant and interesting of Russian
modern writers, and perhaps the best known
outside Russia.</p>

<p>During the war, a writer of fiction made his
name by a remarkable book, namely <span class="smcap">Kuprin</span>,
who in his novel, <i>The Duel</i>, gave a vivid and
masterly picture of the life of an officer in
the line. Kuprin has since kept the promise
of his early work. At the same time, <span class="smcap">Leonid
Andreev</span> came forward with short stories,
plays, a description of war (<i>The Red Laugh</i>),
moralities, not uninfluenced by Maeterlinck,
and a limpid and beautiful style in which
pessimism seemed to be speaking its last
word.</p>

<p>In 1905 the revolutionary movement broke
out, with its great hopes, its disillusions, its
period of anarchy on the one hand and repression
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>249]</a></span>
on the other; out of the chaos of events
came a chaos of writing rather than literature,
and in its turn this produced, in literature
as well as in life, a reaction, or rather a series
of reactions, towards symbolism, &aelig;stheticism,
mysticism on the one hand, and towards
materialism&mdash;not of theory but of practice&mdash;on
the other. But since these various reactions
are now going on, and are vitally affecting
the present day, the revolutionary movement
of 1905 seems the right point to take leave
of Russian literature. In 1905 a new era
began, and what that era will ultimately
produce, it is too soon even to hazard a
guess.</p>

<p>Looking back over the record of Russian
literature, the first thing which must strike
us, if we think of the literature of other
countries, is its comparatively short life.
There is in Russian literature no Middle Ages,
no Villon, no Dante, no Chaucer, no Renaissance,
no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grand Si&egrave;cle</i>. Literature begins
in the nineteenth century. The second thing
which will perhaps strike us is that, in spite
of its being the youngest of all the literatures,
it seems to be spiritually the oldest.
In some respects it seems to have become
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>250]</a></span>
over-ripe before it reached maturity. But
herein, perhaps, lies the secret of its greatness,
and this may be the value of its contribution
to the soul of mankind. It is&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;Old in grief and very wise in tears&rdquo;:<br /></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>and its chief gift to mankind is an expression,
made with a naturalness and sincerity that
are matchless, and a love of reality which is
unique,&mdash;for all Russian literature, whether
in prose or verse, is rooted in reality&mdash;of that
grief and that wisdom; the grief and wisdom
which come from a great heart; a heart that
is large enough to embrace the world and to
drown all the sorrows therein with the immensity
of its sympathy, its fraternity, its
pity, its charity, and its love.</p>
